Changes in stable release 2.6.6 (15-Mar-2016)

* New fvwm features:

  - Support for Russian from Ivan Gayevskiy.
  - EnvMatch supports infostore variables.
  - The option "forget" to the Maximize command allows to
    unmaximize a window without changing its size and position.
  - Windows shaded to a corner (NW, NE, SW, SE) are reduced to a
    small square.
  - New option "!raise" to the WarpToWindow command.
  - The new extended variables $[wa.x], $[wa.y], $[wa.width],
    $[wa.height] can be used to get the geometry of the EWMH
    working area, and $[dwa.x], $[dwa.y], $[dwa.width],
    $[dwa.height] can be used to get the geometry of the EWMH
    dynamic working area.
  - The Resize commands accept "wa" or "da" as a suffix of the
    width or height value.  If present, the value is a percentage
    of the width or height of the EWMH working area or the EWMH
    dynamic working area.
  - Fvwm is much more resilient against applications that flood the
    window manager with repeated events.

* New module features:

  - FvwmForm supports separator lines.
  - New FvwmIconMan options:
      IconAndSelectButton
      IconAndSelectColorset

* Bug fixes:

  - Provide a wrapper for the deprecation of XKeycodeToKeysym and
    use XkbKeycodeToKeysym() where appropriate.
  - fvwm-menu-desktop is re-written and provides better support of
    the XDG menu specification.
  - Fix fvwm-menu-desktop keyError bug.  Use "others" if no desktop
    environment found.
  - FvwmIconMan had problems displaying the highlight colour on some
    systems (64 bit issue?).
  - Globally active windows cannot take the focus if the style
    forbids programs to take focus themselves (style
    !FPFocusByProgram).
  - Windows no longer jump from one position to the other which
    could happen in some cases with SnapAttraction.  Windows now
    snap to the closest window (or screen edge).
  - Removing bindings had several strange side effects that are
    fixed now (removing too many bindings; old bindings showing up
    again after another is removed; possibly other effects).
  - Windows sometimes did not get expose events (i.e. did not
    redraw properly) if they were uncovered by moving a window
    above them.  This has been fixed.
  - FvwmConsole now causes much less network traffic.
  - Suppress bogus events sent to the modules when a window is
    resized with the mouse.
  - Properly handle the has_ref_window_moved flag for ResizeMove and
    ResizeMoveMaximize.
  - Removed some unnecessary redraws in FvwmPager.
  - The option "NoDeskLimitY" option of the GotoPage command did
    not work.
  - Negative coordinates in the "rectangle" option to the Menu
    command did not work correctly.  This has been fixed.
  - Removes a slight graphics problem with the ResizeMaximize
    command being invoked from a window button menu.
  - When an attempt to reparent a client window (i.e. decorate
    it) fails, fvwm no longer throws away all events but only the
    events for that window.
  - The ChangeButton command of FvwmButtons used to strip
    whitespace from the beginning and end of button titles and
    image paths.  This is no longer done.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in stable release 2.6.5 (20-Apr-2012)

* New features:

  - FvwmPager now wraps window names if SmallFont is set.

  - FvwmButtons handles the deleted window correctly for sub-windows.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in stable release 2.6.4 (01-Feb-2012)

* New features:

  - FvwmIconMan no longer allows for itself to be transient by using:

    Module FvwmIconMan Transient

    This is too ambiguous with valid module alias names, hence a
    transient FvwmIconMan must be created with "-Transient" as in:

    Module FvwmIconMan -Transient
  - New command InfoStore -- to store key/value pairs of information
    to relieve the burden of the SetEnv command.
  - Speed-up improvements for fvwm-menu-desktop when generating XDG
    menus by removing unnecessary stat(2) calls.
  - BusyCursor and CursorStyle have been set to make the cursor look
    like a dot during Read/PipeRead commands, by default.

* Bug fixes:

  - FvwmRearrange now understands the "ewmhiwa" option when placing
    windows.
  - Client gravity for subwindows is honoured for reparenting
    windows, such as with XEmbed, when changing the parent's
    geometry.
  - Conditional command processing of !Layer n, as in:

        Next (Xteddy, !Layer 4) Echo cuddles

    has now been fixed.
  - Fixed handling of swallowed windows for transient FvwmButtons'.
  - fvwm-menu-desktop now looks in /usr/share/applications for KDE
    legacy mode.
  - fvwm-config no longer accepts "--is-stable", "--is-released",
    "--is-final".

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in stable release 2.6.3 (30-Sep-2011)

* New features:

  - New Style commands:

        TitleFormat
        IconTitleFormat

        Used to specify a window's visible name.  These new options
        deprecate the older styles:

        IndexedWindowName
        IndexedIconName
        ExactWindowName
        ExactIconName

  - New Resize argument to direction:  "automatic" which works out,
    automatically, which direction a window should be resized in
    based on which quadrant the pointer is in on the window -- this
    is best observed by the grid formed from "ResizeOutline", as the
    shape of this grid is used when calculating this.

    Furthermore, the existing option of "warptoborder" can be used in
    conjunction with "direction automatic" to warp the pointer to the
    appropriate window edge.

  - Couple of changes to the Move command:
        - The EWMH working area is now honoured by default.
        - To move a window ignoring the working area, the option
          "ewmhiwa" can be used, similar to how the Maximize
          command works.

  - New expansion placeholder $[pointer.screen] to return the screen number
    the pointer is on.

* Bug fixes:

    - A few minor ones; nothing user-visible per se.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in stable release 2.6.2 (06-Aug-2011)

* New features:

  - New MenuStyle "UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate" and its
    negation "!UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate" to retain the menu
    until the user presses one of the menu keybindings to enact
    that change in the case where there's only one item defined in
    the menu at the specified hotkey.

* Bug fixes:

  - Fix infinite loop crash when FvwmButtons quits/restarts with
    RootTransparent colorsets.
  - Fix setting window states across FVWM restarts where those
    windows do not set WM_COMMAND.
  - Windows are now correctly restored when coming out of
    fullscreen mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in stable release 2.6.1 (16-Apr-2011)

        - Make XML::Parser check runtime as it's a non-standard
          module.

  - Fix width of FvwmTaskBar to fit on screen properly by using
    the correct module information to determine the border size.
  - Fix resizing shaded windows with a shade direction that does
    not match the window's gravity.  Shaded windows might have
    jumped to strange positions when being resized by the
    application.
  - FvwmIconMan now accepts an optional module alias when running
    in transient mode.
  - Use of the NoUSPosition style is now properly reported by
    "BugOpts ExplainWindowPlacement on".
  - Fix the CursorMove command to no longer move the pointer beyond
    the boundary of a page, if EdgeScroll was set to disable page
    flipping.
  - Fix NeverFocus windows from taking focus when opening menus,
    etc.
  - Plus *MANY* other fixes, improvements, etc.

  dynamical actions using SendToModule, see the man page:

    ChangeButton <button-id> <properties-to-change>

  Inactive means InactiveUp + InactiveDown, similarly for shortcuts
  ToggledActive and ToggledInactive.

* More shortcuts for button states added: AllNormal, AllToggled,
  AllActive, AllInactive, AllUp, AllDown.  These six shortcuts are
  actually different masks for 4 individual states (from 8 total).

* FPClickToFocus and FPClickToRaise work with any modifier by

* Perl library API regarding event handlers is changed, so personal
  modules in Perl should be adjusted.

* Allow the use of mouse buttons other than the first in
  FvwmWinList when invoked transient.

* ImagePath now supports directories in form "/some/directory;.png"
  (where semicolon delimits a file extension that files in

  if the target page was at a negative x or y page displacement
  from the current viewport, the window would be placed on the
  wrong page.

* New Style option IconSize for restricting icon sizes.

* New WindowList options SortClassName, MaxLabelWidth, NoLayer,
  ShowScreen, ShowPage, ShowPageX and ShowPageY.

* Restored old way of handling clicks in windows with ClickToFocus
  and ClickToFocusPassesClickOff.  This fixes a problem with
  click+drag in an unfocused rxvt or aterm window.

* Fixed wrong warp coordinates when WarpToWindow was used with two
  arguments on an unmanaged window.

* Vastly improved FvwmEvent performance.

* FvwmAuto can operate on Enter and Leave events too.  This makes
  it possible to have auto raising with ClickToFocus and

  the FvwmAuto man page.

* The "hangon" strings in FvwmButtons support wild cards.

* New option "Icon" to PlaceAgain command.

    Style * MouseFocusClickRaisesOff

  or vice versa no longer work as like before.  Remove the second
  line to fix the problem.  ClickToFocusRaises now works only on
  the client part of a window, not on the decorations as it did
  before.

* New color limit method for screens that only display 256 colors
  (or less).

* In depth less or equal to 16 image and gradient can be
  dithered. This can be enabled/disabled by using the new
  dither/nodither options to the Colorset command.

* Removed the styles MouseFocusClickIgnoreMotion and
  MouseFocusClickIgnoreMotionOff again.

* Many new focus policy styles "FP..." and "!FP...".

  scheme. fvwm-bug, fvwm-root (was xpmroot), fvwm-config,
  fvwm-convert-2.4.

* New flags (No)FvwmModule to FvwmButtons Swallow option

* The I18N_MB patch (--enable-multibyte) has been
  rewritten. MULTIBYTE is used to identify what is was I18N_MB. A
  set of locale functions (locale initialization, font loading,
  text drawing, ...etc.) is created in libs/Flocale.{c,h} and used
  in the entire fvwm code (but FvwmWharf).  Font loading and
  memory management is improved in the multibyte case.

* Better support of non ISO-8859-1 window and icon titles. See the
  --disable-compound-text option in INSTALL.fvwm for more
  details.

* Added anti-aliased text rendering support using Xft (use
  --enable-xft to enable it). Recent versions of XFree and
  freetype2 are needed (see the FONT NAMES AND FONT LOADING
  section of the fvwm manual page).

* Conditional commands now have a return code (Match, NoMatch or
  Error).  This return code can be checked and tied to an action
  with the new commands Cond and CondCase.

  with the new contexts '[', ']', '-', '_', '<', '^', '>' and
  'v'.

  WindowShadeAlwaysLazy to optimize performance of the WindowShade
  command.

  the maximized geometry of windows and maximize them as
  necessary.  Very useful to make a window larger manually and
  then get back the old geometry with a click.
