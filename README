Welcome to FVWM version 2.5.x  FVWM is a multiple large virtual desktop
window manager, originally (a looooong time ago!) derived from twm.

FVWM is intended to have a small memory footprint but a rich feature
set, be extremely customizable and extendible, and have a high degree of
Motif mwm compatibility.

For users of the old FVWM 1.xx, please be aware that version 2.2 has a
lot of differences.

For users of the FVWM 2.0.x betas, please be aware that version 2.2 uses
GNU autoconf/automake rather than Imake, so things will install in
different places by default.

For users of the FVWM 2.2.x, please read the files ANNOUNCE and NEWS to
figure out all changes and new features in this release.

FVWM's original author, Rob Nation (THANKS ROB!), has "retired" from
work on it, so please don't bother him with silly little things like bug
reports or enhancement requests.  Care and feeding of FVWM is now
handled by a group of people on the fvwm-workers mailing list, with many
contributions by fans everywhere.

If you have any questions, concerns, bug reports, enhancement requests,
etc., please read the files in the docs/ subdirectory first.  In
particular the FAQ, BUGS, and TODO lists.  Also, check the FVWM man page
carefully.  Next, try the FVWM mailing list.  Another excellent resource
is the official WWW page http://www.fvwm.org and the mailing list archives
found there.

For information on compiling and installing FVWM, see the INSTALL and
INSTALL.fvwm files (INSTALL is the boilerplate autoconf instruction
file; INSTALL.fvwm contains FVWM-specific details).

Generally, you should run:

  ./configure   # for full list of options, run: ./configure --help
  make
  make install  # as a user with proper file system permissions

It is very important to make the last step (make install) to ensure that
FVWM works properly.

For known bugs, check out the BUGS, FAQ and TODO files.

Have fun!
