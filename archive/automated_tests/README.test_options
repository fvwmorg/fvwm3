Run the test_options script from this directory.
It will configure and build fvwm multiple times for every selected
combination of configure options (currently 14 options).

Parameters:

  -0: build once with all options disabled/enabled (2 builds)
  -1: build once with any single option disabled/enabled (28 builds)
  -2: build once with any combination of two options disabled/enabled
      (182 builds)

The default is 'test_options -0 -1' since '-2' can take *really* a long time
(at 10 minutes per built it takes one and a half day).

A summary logfile test_options.log is generated as well as an additional log
for every build (test_options.log.*). The names are self explaining.
