.SH NAME
FvwmForm - input form module for Fvwm
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBModule FvwmForm\fP [ \fIAlias\fP ]

FvwmForm must be spawned by Fvwm.
If invoked from the command line,
FvwmForm prints its version number and exits.
.SH DESCRIPTION
FvwmForm provides a mechanism to get user input and act accordingly.
This is achieved by means of a form that the user can fill out,
and from which the user can select actions he wants Fvwm to take.
A form consists of five types of items:
text labels,
single-line text inputs,
mutually-exclusive selections,
multiple-choice selections,
and action buttons.
These items are arranged into several lines,
with a very flexible layout.

A text label only serves the purpose of explanation.
It cannot accept any input.

A timeout entry provides a mechanism for timing out the form
and performing a certain action when the timeout occurs.  The countdown
is displayed similar to a text label except that it updates with the
amount of time left.

A text input field can be used to edit a single-line string.
FvwmForm accepts Emacs-style cursor movement keys.
See FvwmFormInput for details.
Mouse copy is not supported, but you can paste.

A selection consists of several choices.

The selection itself is a logical entity that doesn't have any display
feature.

Each choice is displayed as a push-button followed by a explanatory
text label.
When selected, an exclusive choice shows a circle in the middle,
while a multiple choice shows a check.

An action button, when activated sends one or more commands to
Fvwm or executes shell commands.
The shell commands can contain the content of the input fields
on the form and reflect the setting of choices on the form.

The action buttons can be activated thru keyboard or mouse.
.SH INITIALIZATION

FvwmForm invoked without an alias uses configuration
commands  starting with "*FvwmForm".

Normally you would invoke FvwmForm with
an alias representing the name of a form, its configuration commands and
configuration file.
For example, the command "Module FvwmForm Rlogin" uses configuration
commands starting with "*Rlogin", and reads the optional configuration file
"Rlogin".

All forms, regardless of alias,  scan first for configuration commands
that start with  "*FvwmFormDefault".   These  commands  normally come
from the builtin form "FvwmForm-Form" which saves commands to the file
".FvwmForm".

The physical reading of the optional input file, ".FvwmForm",
is done only the first time FvwmForm is invoked, or after
"FvwmForm-Form" updates the file.

When the file ".FvwmForm" is read,  it is done  by sending the command
"Read .FvwmForm  Quiet"   to fvwm.  Because of  the   way the  "read"
command works, the file can  reside in your personal fvwm user directory,
or be in the fvwm data directory.  See the description of the read
command in the fvwm man page for more information about the environment
variable $FVWM_USERDIR.

Then FvwmForm reads the rest of the configuration fvwm has stored
up.  Fvwm stores configuration on an ongoing basis.  The initial
configuration comes from the .fvwm2rc file.  Other sources,
including "Read" commands can define a form.

When letting  FvwmForm and fvwm  read files, remember that these files
contain commands  that can  execute shell commands,  so  you should be
careful about setting permissions on these files.

When FvwmForm is invoked with a window context, e.g. from a window menu,
all commands it sends to Fvwm will have that window context.
This would allow FvwmForm to control the window it is invoked from.

After all the configuration commands have been read, FvwmForm displays
the form defined by the commands.

.SH DEFAULTS
FvwmForm creates a built-in form named "FvwmForm-Form" that creates
a file called ".FvwmForm".  This file contains saved default form colors and
fonts.  Other forms use these defaults unless they are overridden within the
form.

The default creating form would normally be invoked from a "module menu".
For example, if you call your module menu "Module-Popup", you would
add the line:
.EX
AddToMenu "Module-Popup" "FvwmForm Defaults" FvwmForm FvwmForm-Form
.EE
When you select "FvwmForm Defaults" from your module menu,
a form is displayed that shows the current defaults and allows you
to change them.  If you activate the "Save Restart Me" button,
the ".FvwmForm" file is written and "FvwmForm-Form" exits and restarts
to show the new defaults.

An example of what this file might contain after a save is:
.EX
  # This file last created by FvwmForm-Form on Sun Nov 28 11:18:26 EST 1999.
  *FvwmFormDefault: Font 10x20
  *FvwmFormDefault: InputFont 8x13bold
  *FvwmFormDefault: ButtonFont 10x20
  *FvwmFormDefault: TimeoutFont 10x20
  *FvwmFormDefault: Fore white
  *FvwmFormDefault: Back cornflowerblue
  *FvwmFormDefault: Colorset -1
  *FvwmFormDefault: ItemFore green
  *FvwmFormDefault: ItemBack gray40
  *FvwmFormDefault: ItemColorset -1
  *FvwmFormDefault: ButtonPointer hand2
  *FvwmFormDefault: ButtonInPointer star
  *FvwmFormDefault: InputPointer gumby
  *FvwmFormDefault: ButtonPointerFore blue
  *FvwmFormDefault: ButtonPointerBack gray
  *FvwmFormDefault: ButtonInPointerFore gray
  *FvwmFormDefault: ButtonInPointerBack blue
  *FvwmFormDefault: InputPointerFore
  *FvwmFormDefault: InputPointerBack
.EE
The commands in this file are just like any other FvwmForm
command except that they start with "*FvwmFormDefault".

FvwmForm only reads the file ".FvwmForm" the first time it is started
or after the file is changed by "FvwmForm-Form".  It does so
by sending the command "*FvwmFormDefault: Read x". With "x" set to "y" or
"n".  "n" makes FvwmForm send a "read .FvwmForm quiet" command to fvwm.

.SH VARIABLE SUBSTITUTION

If you supply variables and values on the command line used to start
FvwmForm (like this):

.EX
Module FvwmForm MyForm ACTION=Browse "TITLE=Browse Form"
.EE

Then all FvwmForm input commands undergo variable substitution.
The variables from the command line are exported.
Then every command gets expanded using the variables from the
environment.  For example, assuming the above invocation
of "MyForm", commands would be changed like this:

.EX
Before  *MyForm: Text "$TITLE, Home $HOME, Going to $ACTION"
After   *MyForm: TEXT "Browse Form, Home /home/me, Going to Browse"
.EE

Using this facility should make it possible for one form to be used for
different sets of input data.

.SH CONFIGURATION
The following commands can be set in the .fvwm2rc file or thru
any of the other ways that fvwm can accept commands.
The simplest technique is to create a file in the read-only
architecture-independent data directory,
[PREFIX/share/fvwm] or your personal fvwm directory [$HOME/.fvwm],
that matches the form alias.

In the following paragraphs the string "FvwmForm"
would normally be the form alias.

FvwmForm reads commands before the form is ever displayed,
and while the form is being displayed.

The following commands are accepted before the form is displayed:
.EX
Back
Button
ButtonFont
ButtonInPointer
ButtonInPointerFore
ButtonInPointerBack
ButtonPointer
ButtonPointerFore
ButtonPointerBack
Choice
Command
Colorset
Font
Fore
GrabServer
Input
InputFont
InputPointer
ItemBack
ItemColorset
ItemFore
InputPointerFore
InputPointerBack
Line
Message
PadVText
Position
Selection
Separator
Text
Timeout
TimeoutFont
Title
UseData
WarpPointer
.EE

The following commands are accepted while the form is displayed:
.EX
Map
Stop
UnMap
.EE

The "Map", "UnMap" and "Stop" facility is under development
and is currently not explained in this document, since it is likely
to change.

The order of the options DOES matter.
The first background text color, "*FvwmFormBack",
encountered before
a displayable item
sets the default
background color for the entire form.

Other than that, colors, fonts, text, choices and buttons
can be intermixed in any order.
The are no builtin limits on form size, number of items on
a form, or number of fonts or colors used.

.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: GrabServer
This option makes FvwmForm grab the mouse pointer on startup.
This feature is useful for things like logout verification.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: WarpPointer
This option makes FvwmForm warp the mouse pointer into its window on startup.
It saves the user some mouse-travelling.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: Geometry \fIgeometry\fP
Specifies the FvwmForm window location.  This is similar to what
the Position option does but is more flexible.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: Position \fIx\fP \fIy\fP
Puts the FvwmForm window at location (\fIx\fP, \fIy\fP) on the screen.
By convention, a negative \fIx\fP (\fIy\fP) value measures
distance from the right (bottom) of the screen.

If this option is omitted, FvwmForm starts at the center of the screen.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: Colorset \fIn\fP
Tells the module to use colorset \fIn\fP.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: Back \fIcolor\fP
Specifies the background color of the FvwmForm window
and any text in the window.
The first background color FvwmForm reads determines the overall
screen background color. Switches off the Colorset option.
See DEFAULTS.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: Fore \fIcolor\fP
Specifies the foreground color for displaying text labels.
Switches off the Colorset option.
See DEFAULTS.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: ItemColorset \fIn\fP
Tells the module to use colorset \fIn\fP for items.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: ItemBack \fIcolor\fP
Specifies the background color for the text input windows, and
the buttons.
Buttons are displayed as 3D depressable buttons.
Inputs are displayed as 3D indented fields.
Medium shade background colors work best.
Switches off the ItemColorset option.
See DEFAULTS.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: ItemFore \fIcolor\fP
Specifies the foreground color for the text input strings and button
text. Switches off the ItemColorset option.
See DEFAULTS.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: Font \fIfont\fP
Specifies the font for displaying plain text.
See DEFAULTS.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: ButtonFont \fIfont\fP
Specifies the font for text in the action buttons.
See DEFAULTS.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: InputFont \fIfont\fP
Specifies the font for text input.
See DEFAULTS.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: TimeoutFont \fIfont\fP
Specifies the font for display the timeout counter and related text.
See DEFAULTS.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: Line \fIjustification\fP
Starts a new line.
A line can contain any number of text, input, buttons and choice items.
A FvwmForm window can have any number of lines.
The width of the window is that of the longest line.

Justification of items in the line is specified by \fIjustification\fP,
which can be one of the following:
.TP 16
.B \fIleft\fP
Items are justified to the left of the window.
.TP 16
.B \fIright\fP
Items are justified to the right of the window.
.TP 16
.B \fIcenter\fP
Items are placed in the center of the window.
.TP 16
.B \fIexpand\fP
If there is only one item in the line, the item is centered in the window.
If two or more items are present, they are spread to fill the whole
width of the window.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: Message
Defines a text area on the form that contains the last error message
from fvwm.  For purposes of determining form size, the message area
is considered to be 80 bytes long.  Its actual length is the same as
the message received.  If the message exceeds 80 bytes, you can see the
rest of the message by resizing the form.

You should not attempt to put any text, buttons or input fields on the
same line after a message field.  Messages greater than 80 bytes will overlay
the remainder of the line.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: PadVText "\fIPixels\fP"
The number of pixels used as vertical padding between text items, line
to line.  The default is 6 which looks good on lines containing text
intermixed with input boxes, choices or buttons.

For straight text, such as might appear on a help form, padding of
zero looks better.

(There are lots of other padding values used in form layout
which can't currently be changed with commands.)
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: Text "\fIstring\fP"
Displays \fIstring\fP as plain text.
Line breaks must be achieved by multiple *FvwmForm: Line and *FvwmForm: Text
options.
Blanks may be used to provide extra padding between items.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: Title "\fIstring\fP"
Displays \fIstring\fP as the window's title.  The string
must be enclosed in double quotes.  Using this command with anything
other than a string enclosed in quotes creates a blank title.
If this command is not used, the window title is the form alias.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: Input \fIname\fP \fIsize\fP "\fIinit_string\fP"
Specifies a text input item with name \fIname\fP.
A sub window of \fIsize\fP characters in width is used for editing.
If \fIinit_string\fP is present, it is the initial string when
FvwmForm starts or resets itself.
The default initial string is "".

You can mouse paste into an input field using button 2.
Buttons 1 and 3 move the cursor in an input field.

Input fields are always in insert mode, overtyping is not supported.

Emacs type keystrokes are supported.

Control-a, Home and Begin move to the front of an input field.
Control-e and End move to the end of an input field.
Control-b and Left move left in an input field.
Control-f and Right move right in an input field.
Control-p, Up, and Shift-Tab move to a previous input field if any,
if the form has one input field, recall previous value.
Control-n, Down, Return, Line-feed and Tab move to the next input field if any,
if the form has one input field, for control-n and Down, restore previous
input value.
Control-h moves backward in an input field erasing a character.
Control-d and Delete delete the next character in an input field.
Control-k erases for the cursor to the end of an input field.
Control-u erases the entire input field.

When a form executes a command, all the input values are saved in
a ring of input history 50 items deep.

Meta(mod2)-"<" retrieves the previous value of an input field.
Meta(mod2)-">" retrieves the next value of an input field.

(For forms with one input field, use the much easier arrow keys.)

.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: Selection \fIname\fP \fItype\fP
This option starts a selection item with name \fIname\fP.
Its choices are specified in following configuration commands.
The option \fItype\fP is one of the following:
.TP 16
.B \fIsingle\fP
The selections are mutually exclusive.
.TP 16
.B \fImultiple\fP
This is a multiple-choice selection.

.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: Separator
Draws a 2 pixel shaded line across the form as a visual indication
of a separate area.

.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: Choice \fIname\fP \fIvalue\fP "on | off" "\fIstring\fP"
Specifies a choice for a proceeding selection.
The choice item has a \fIname\fP and a \fIvalue\fP these are used in
commands.  See *FvwmForm: Command.
The \fIstring\fP is displayed to the right of the choice button
as a label.

The choice assumes the specified initial state ("on" means selected)
when FvwmForm starts or resets.
If the selections are mutually exclusive,
FvwmForm does NOT detect inconsistencies in the initial states of the choices,
i.e. two or none of the choices can be selected.
However, once the user selects a choice,
FvwmForm  assures only one is selected.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: Button \fItype\fP "\fIstring\fP" [\fIkey\fP]
This option specifies an action button.
The button has \fIstring\fP as a label,
and executes a set of Fvwm \fIcommand\fP when it is activated.
The commands are the following *FvwmForm: Commands.

The optional \fIkey\fP specifies a keyboard shortcut that activates
the button.
It is in either a control character, specified as ^@, ^A, ..., ^_,
or a function key, specified as F1, F2, ..., F35.
Control keys that are used for cursor movement in text input fields
cannot activate any buttons, with the exception of
TAB (^I), RETURN (^M), LINEFEED (^J),
which can activate a button when the cursor is in the last text input field.

The behavior of the button is determined by \fItype\fP:
.TP 16
continue
FvwmForm continues execution after sending the commands.
.TP 16
restart
After sending the commands,
FvwmForm resets all the values to the initial ones,
and then continues execution.
.TP 16
quit
FvwmForm quits after sending the commands.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: Command \fIcommand\fP
This option specifies an Fvwm command associated with the current button.
There can be more than one command attached to a button.
Commands that appear before any *FvwmForm: Button option are executed
at start-up time.  This is usually a beep that gets the user's attention.

Commands starting with an exclamation mark (!) are executed by FvwmForm,
all other commands are sent to Fvwm for execution.
Before sending each command to Fvwm, FvwmForm recognizes variables of the
following forms, and supply values to them.
.TP 16
.B $(\fIname\fP)
If \fIname\fP corresponds to a text input field,
the result is the user's input string.
The special chars single-quote, double-quote and backslash
are preceded by a backslash.

If \fIname\fP corresponds to a choice,
the result is the value of the choice (as specified in *FvwmForm: Choice)
if the choice is selected.
If the choice is not selected, the result is a blank string.

If \fIname\fP corresponds to a selection,
the result will be a list of the selected values of all its choices
separated by spaces.
.TP 16
.B $(\fIname\fP?\fIstring\fP)
If \fIname\fP is a text input field and its value is not an empty string,
the result is \fIstring\fP,
with recursive variable substitution applied.
If the input value is empty, the result is empty.

If \fIname\fP is a choice and it is selected,
the result is \fIstring\fP,
with recursive variable substitution applied.
If the choice is not selected, the result is empty.
.TP 16
.B $(\fIname\fP!\fIstring\fP)
The same as the above, except that the converse conditions are taken.

When using the "?" and "!" forms to pass a string, the string is delimited
by a right parenthesis.  If you need to put a right parenthesis in a string,
precede the right parenthesis with a backslash.

.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: UseData \fIdatafile\fP \fIleading\fP
Tells FvwmForm to read a data file and extract data from module
commands that match the "leading" argument and an input,
choice, or selection variable in a form.

This lets a form display current fvwm module configuration data.
For an example of how this works, examine the file "FvwmForm-Rlogin"
which is installed in read-only architecture-independent data directory,
[PREFIX/share/fvwm] and shown below.

For choices, the setting of the button is represented as the
word "on",  all other values for a setting are treated as off.

For selections, the setting of each choice button is determined
by matching the current value of the selection against each
choice.  Currently, this only works correctly for selections
that allow a single choice.
.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: ButtonPointer \fIpointername\fP
Change the default mouse pointer (hand2) used when hovering over a button.
The pointername must be one of the names defined in
the include file X11/cursorfont.h (without the XC_ prefix).
See DEFAULTS.

.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: ButtonInPointer \fIpointername\fP
Change the default mouse pointer (hand1) used
while a button is pressed in.
The pointername must be one of the names defined in
the include file X11/cursorfont.h (without the XC_ prefix).
See DEFAULTS.

.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: InputPointer \fIpointername\fP
Change the default mouse pointer (xterm) used
while the pointer is over a text field.
The pointername must be one of the names defined in
the include file X11/cursorfont.h (without the XC_ prefix).
See DEFAULTS.

.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: ButtonPointerFore|Back \fIcolor\fP
Change the default mouse pointer foreground and background colors
used when hovering over a button.
See DEFAULTS.

.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: ButtonInPointerFore|Back \fIcolor\fP
Change the default mouse pointer foreground and background colors
used while a button is pressed in.
See DEFAULTS.

.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: InputPointerFore|Back \fIcolor\fP
Change the default mouse pointer foreground and background colors
used while the pointer is over a text field.
See DEFAULTS.

.TP 4
.B *FvwmForm: Timeout \fIseconds\fP \fIcommand\fP \fI"text"\fP
Set up FvwmForm to time out after the amount of \fIseconds\fP
specified.  When the timer hits zero, \fIcommand\fP executes.  The
\fItext\fP field is displayed much like a \fIText\fP
field, except that a '%%' in the line is replaced automatically by
the amount of time left on the timer.  The value gets updated every
second as the timer counts down.
There can only be one timeout field per form.

.SH EXAMPLES

.SH EXAMPLE 4 - Talk Form
This example provides a replacement for the module FvwmTalk.
There are 2 forms, "FvwmForm-Talk." which executes commands,
or sends commands to fvwm for execution, and "FvwmForm-TalkHelp."
which is a help form.

In the help form, notice how vertical line
spacing is changed.  Normal FvwmForm line spacing assumes text is
intermixed with buttons, help forms require different spacing.
