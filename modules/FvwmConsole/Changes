-- 08/28/97 -- 1.3.2

	1. moved socket in home directory from /tmp in order to avoid
       remote chance of connecting to somebody else's fvwm (this
       could be interesting).
    2. command history is kept in a file from the previous session.
    3. The maximum command length is now 1000, up from 255.
       This should be used with fvwm with this limit (greater than
       but not equal to 2.0.45). Long module path and such can be
       input now.
    4. FvwmConsoleC.pl (1.2) looks slightly smoother. (08/22/97)

	With patch from Paul D Smith

	1. changed ADD_INCLUDE variable to EXTRA_INCLUDES in Imakefile.
    2. changed the man page. It makes sense now!
    3. added Tab key binding as tab insertion to make cut-and-
       paste easier.
    4. Handles backslashed command lines. Long lines are hard to
       type and hard to read.

    With patch from Al Bolduc (08/28/97)

    1. runs on BSD/OS which has another element in the sockaddr_un
       structure.

Changes on 1.2
-- 08/22/96 ---

   1. Deleted unnecessary defines and headers. The less, the better.
   2. Changed maximum command size to 255 to prevent module
      termination.
   3. One less process. The less , the better.

Changes on  1.1

   1. Fixed the bug that didn't allocate enough memory for the child
       process arguments.

   2. Get module configuration from Fvwm and pass them to the
      client.

Changes on FvwmConsoleC.pl 1.1

   1. Added substitution and other editing functions.

   2. Keybindings can be configured through module configuration.
