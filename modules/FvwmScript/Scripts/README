The directory ./Examples contains some examples of what can we do with
FvwmScript:

	- BellSetup: desk accessory to modify bell. This script
requires xsetup.
	- Buttons: buttons panel wich can replace FvwmButtons. 
This script support popup menu and requires xload, xclock, 
FvwmPager, TkDesk and some icons wich are located at the fvwm web site.
	- Date: desk accessory to setup date and time, requires
xclock and date.
	- KeyboardSetup: desk accessory to setup keyboard, requires
xsetup.
	- Quit: scritp to confirm "Logout" or "Restart computer"
	- ScreenSetup: desk accessory to customize background display
and screen saver.
	- fvwmrc: my preferred fvwm config wich use all the six scripts.


N.B. BellSetup, KeyBoardSetup and ScreenSetup save preferences to 
~/.xinit-fvwmrc. If you want to load these preferences at every startup,
you have to include the line ".xinit-fvwmrc" in your .xinitrc before
the line "fvwm".

I hope that FvwmScript will interest you. In any case, please send me a short email and
tell me what you think about FvwmScript.
