 * 200396: Updated TODO file some.

 * 210396: Fixed Desk buttons that didn't hang correctly.

 * 280396: Chuck: Fixed some problems with macro definitions  min,max and abs
   on AIX

 * 280396: Think I fixed the problem that made windows get huge on machines
   with non-cleaning mallocs (AIXs) when no global Frame was specified.

 * 280396: Somehow the string "*blabla" should have _2_ chars more allocated
   than "blabla" or the parser would choke and die on some ELF linux system..
   Thanks to Dirk Vangestel for this.

Changed since FvwmButtons-200396

 * 200396: Hups, seems I introduced a little bug that made it reluctant to 
   swallow some windows, particularly shaped ones... Should be back to normal
   now.

 * 200396: Thanks to Romano again for saving my ass - I managed to remove
   the initialization of b->flags, creating major disasters on startup.

Changed since FvwmButtons-130396

 * 130396: Did lots and lots of things, actually had pixmaps for backgrounds
   working, and had started a complete restructuring of the source (again)
   Then the disk crashed. Good. Happy.

 * 140396: Fixed real inheritance of swallow flags.

 * 140396: Fixed bug which dumped core if Desk buttons were present.

 * 140396: Check before redrawing background/padding if it's needed.

 * 140396: Gave bitmaps the correct background color.

 * 180396: On slow systems, when using the UseOld flag on several buttons,
   it could spawn several copies of each program. Now only spawns after 
   _first_ M_END_WINDOWLIST, not every one.
   Also made it honor inherited UseOld flags and not spawn on startup.

 * 180396: Some editing... does every cpp understand '#    ifdef A' ?

 * 180396: Removed a couple of calls to buttonJustify in draw.c..

 * 190396: Made the parser properly use tolower() when comparing, preparing for
   i18n to LC_CTYPE... 

 * 200396: Updated somewhat to work with latest fvwmlib picture patch of mine.

 * 200396: Again changed the resource name and class, now it is (in ICCCM
   compliance) the invoking name and FvwmButtons, respectively.

 * 200396: Now also does shaped bitmaps w/o xpm library. You won't notice
   until the background pixmaps are done though. Also fixed a memory leak 
   where the temporary pixmap made for a bitmap was not deleted.

 * 200396: Now uses the picture caching introduced with the fvwmlib patch
   mentioned above. This patch btw also applies to fvwm menus, could save
   major amounts of memory (say 50 equal 16x16 pixmaps - you save 49 times
   512 bytes for just the pixmaps and the masks (assuming 8bit display),
   plus some overhead. Not to mention it should start much faster!

 * 200396: Now uses XTranslateCoordinates instead of XQueryTree to find 
   real coords when swallowing a window.

Changed since FvwmButtons-120396

 * 120396: Now properly avoids modifying icons on monochrome displays. This
   used to ruin xpm's mono settings. A patch for the Picture code in fvwmlib
   is also needed, get my fvwm-picture-pl2.patch, and also fvwm-menus.patch
   which will fix the same problem for fvwm menus.

 * 130396: Fixed two typos on the man page, thanks to Brandon for noticing.

 * 130396: Improved parser to ignore leading spaces in buttonrc files, and
   to accept any amount of whitespace between *FvwmButtons and (...) in
   .fvwm[2]rc. Thanks to Alan for pointing this weakness out.

 * 130396: The main call to XCreateSimpleWindow would give random x,y coords
   unless given a geometry, perhaps that is allowable when using a WM, but not
   without. This is now fixed.

 * 130396: Now uses XSetWMProperty instead of XmbSetWMProperty, to please
   those stuck with X11R4. Thanks to Angiolini Giorgio for the information.

 * 130396: Fixed parser to cope with Exec something, i.e. without the ""
   empty hangon notifier. It used to garb this up, trying to do Exec mething.
   Fixed man page to reflect the change.

Changed since FvwmButtons-110396b

 * 120396: Added lots of debug information for swallow/unswallow. Finally did
   it all properly when exiting, no more X Errors when restarting fvwm from
   FvwmButtons :-) FvwmButtons grabs the server, and goes through the 
   pending eventlist to decide which windows have been destroyed by fvwm
   already before deciding to kill,close or reparent. Or ignore. After all
   children are handled, ther server is ungrabbed.

 * 120396: Added some debugging output for events and fvwm communication.
   Now uses only SendText instead of both SendInfo and SendText (duplicates).

 * 120396: Fixed the position detection routine for buttonpresses, should now
   be a little more accurate.

 * 120396: Fixed stupid negated #ifdef that tried to use the XPM color loading
   if you didn't have it, and not if you did.

 * 120396: Finally! Removed the superfluous XFree that had made FvwmButtons
   unusable to many people! Thanks, thanks and many more thanks to Romano
   Giannetti for tracing down this stupid bug! I mean, the variable it freed
   wan't even used! Romano is hereby awarded the title "Bugslayer" for this
   outstanding feat. Applause!

 * 120396: Added some more starting debug info that should be unneeded after
   the above fix.

 * 120396: Turned _off_ most debug options by default. Moved them to the 
   header file.

 * 120396: Cleaned up a few unused variables. Added #include <ctype.h> to
   parse.c, after advice from Romano.

Changed since FvwmButtons-110396

 * 110396: Fixed bug where, if Respawn was specified by a container, and a
   button had specifed NoRespawn, it would still respawn. Or the opposite
   situation, Respawn locally and NoRespawn higher up, would cause NoRespawn.

 * 110396: Fixed bug where x padding would be set equal to y padding if no
   padding was specified for a button. 

 * 110396: Wrote a file INSTALL and a samplebuttonrc file.

 * 110396: Fixed bug where containers would get padding and information from
   parents on redraw, when they were not supposed to.

 * 110396: Fixed bug where icons left of title would not be clipped properly
   when the button was sized too small.

 * 110396: Added error messages telling when a font could not be loaded.

 * 110396: Turned on lots of starting info by default (turn it off by
   commenting out the defines in FvwmButtons.c) which will hopefully help
   people understand what is going on when it dumps core on them.

 * 110396: Fixed bug where bitmaps would get drawn with current background
   instead of the one given for the button.

 * 110396: Fixed ShuffleButtons to reduce the number of rows if there are
   too many of them. This should correctly handle single buttons without
   giving rows or columns options.

 * 110396: FvwmButtons will now not create windows less than 16x16 pixels,
   in case you have not provided a geometry or any buttons from which 
   FvwmButtons can calculate a unit buttonsize.

Changed since FvwmButtons-080396

 * 090396: Parser now accepts escaped quoting characters in quote. Only the 
   current quoting character is unescaped while parsing, i.e:
     Action `Exec emacs \`xcb -p 1\` -title \"hello\"`
   would give 
     Exec emacs `xcb -p 1` -title \"hello\"
   Also, the string "\\"" would be read to \", as only the sequence \q will
   be collapsed, where q is the quoting character.
   Thanks to Emiel Witteman <ewittema@wi.leidenuniv.nl> for pointing out the
   necessity of this improvement.

 * 090396: Rewrote flag handling, now you can specify title flags and swallow
   flags in the container part, like Container(Title(Left,Side)) and that will
   count for all subbuttons. This also goes for all the swallowing flags, and
   these negatives have been introduced: Kill, Hints, NoRespawn, NoOld, 
   NoTitle. All this is yet not fully tested.
   There is no negative for Title(Side) because this is a Hack! (see README)

 * 090396: Made a patch to fvwm-2.0.41 that allows any module to pop up a real
   Popup menu! Just use it as a regular command - it's like a dream.

 * 090396: Changed ResourceName to "FvwmButtons" and ResourceClass to 
   "FvwmModule", regardless of what name the module is given at runtime.

 * 090396: Split up source some more, mostly to ease maintenance and get 
   faster recompiles.

 * 090396: Took a shot at the exposure handler, relaxed the updating a little,
   now there is _much_ less flashing when redrawing, and it only redraw parts
   that are part of the expose.

 * 090396: Moderated ending efforts to WM_DELETE_WINDOW instead of KillClient.
   However some programs don't understand that, so remodeled Kill,NoKill flags
   to decide if KillClient should be used. The old Kill,NoKill are now 
   Close,NoClose.

 * 090396: Updated the man page somewhat on the flag changes.

 * 090396: Rewrote icon handling to use fvwmlib's Picture routines, the same
   that are used for fvwm's menus. Made a patch to fix bitmap searching for 
   this.

 * 090396: Tidied away all the colorcloseness settings, it's the same level
   as the other xpm stuff used so no extra checking needs be done.

 * 090396: Fixed bitmap icons, which converted from 1 to X planes each time
   they were drawn, bummer.

 * 090396: Actually fixed most problems with resizing to a very small size.
   Swallowed windows might still give you X Errors though, if they don't like
   being 1x1.

 * 110396: Added config option  *FvwmButtonsFile string  which will read the
   config from the file "string" instead. Also, this can be given as an
   argument starting with:  FvwmButtons FvwmTesting string
   This config file is the same as in .fvwm[2]rc, but you don't put
   *FvwmButtons in front of all the lines.
   The filename will have to be given with full path or be relative to the
   dir you started fvwm in. No preprocessor is available, but it does '#'
   comments and linecontinuation.

Changed since FvwmButtons-070396

 * 080396: Now _really_ works with common PixmapPath and IconPath. I have even
   tested it this time :-)

 * 080396: Rewrote swallowing: If a window disappears between M_WINDOW_NAME etc
   and M_MAP, it is assumed crashed, no further action. But if the window 
   simply has gotten another parent, we assume some other swallower got to it
   before us, so we release our hold and give a new Send_Windowlist to find
   another fitting window, and if that fails, spawns one ourself.
   Still, best to avoid competition about windows to be swallowed, use 
   different titles. It still easily fails if it processes an out of date
   windowlist.

 * 080396: Put in some more debugging output, controlled by the defines in
   the head of FvwmButtons.c.

 * 080396: Now, when quitting FvwmButtons, it checks to see if a window still
   exists before trying to kill it or unswallow it.

 * 080396: Added Size w h command, assures a button get at least this large.
   Great for buttonboxes with only swallowed windows.

 * 080396: Man page: Added Size description, replaced some "frame"s with
   "relief" (Maybe the option should be changed also?), added a subsection
   on how initial buttonsizes are calculated, changed #908090 to rgb:90/80/90
   to conform to X standards, and wrote a blurb saying so, and what to
   consider when using the older # method.
 
 * 080396: Fixed redrawing buttons - now the container padding is cleared
   correctly also when resized to mismatching sizes.

 * 080396: FvwmButtons now allocates only one graphic context instead of 3.
   Shadow of buttons are now longer handled specially for monochrome screens.

 * 080396: Hacked an option to the Title command, Title(Side) now stacks
   Icon and Title side by side. It also left justifies the icon automatically.
   Between the icon and title there is the horizontal padding space.
   Added it to the man page.

Changed since FvwmButtons-060396

 * 060396: Made if startable as "Module FvwmButtons SomeButtons", or even
   "FvwmButtons SomeButtons", which will name it SomeButton and does away
   with silly softlinks.

 * 060396: Fixed the close color allocation via Xpm to work with xpm versions
   back to 3.2b, which was released october 92. There was really no need of
   using features from 3.4g.

 * 060396: Rewrote font loading, for no particular reason.

 * 070396: Did some work on individual color settings, now Fore and Back can
   be set in buttons and in containers. 

 * 070396: Take back suggestion that ConfigureNotify is autofollowed by
   Expose, not true when no subwindows. Now ConfigureNotify Resize does a
   full redraw.
 
 * 070396: Fixed Right option of strings, which was broken. For instance,
   when used, title became left justified. Also it was a little confused
   about which font to use where.

 * 070396: Update man page to specify Back and Fore colors and mention 
   argument namechange. (I.e FvwmButtons AnotherName invocation.)

Changed since FvwmButtons-040396

 * 060396: Removed a bug that would choke on buttons with "Desk xxxx" commands
   on them. Thanks to Robert Tarrall <tarrall@plutus.colorado.edu>.

 * 060396: Color-closeness behaviour has been disabled by default, as it 
   requires xpm-3.4g or newer. Several people had trouble with this. It now
   avoids this code if your xpm include is too old.

 * 060396: Removed bug that made it ignore an xpm when it was in the same
   directory searched for bitmaps.

 * 060396: Now sets Class and Resource to FvwmButtons (or bound name) instead
   of NoClass, NoResource. Code copied from FvwmTalk.

 * 060396: Parser no longer accepts '(' and ')' as quoting characters, those
   are reserved for optional parameters. String quotation characters available
   are "string", 'string' and `string`, the last one should be used if you 
   want preprocessors to get inside.

 * 060396: Some general cleanup of unused variables and unclean typing. Got a
   little shocked when I saw what good ol' -Wall came up with. 

 * 060396: Changed Action syntax, removed Mouse syntax. Mouse # command shall
   now be given as Action(Mouse #) command. Future extensions of this will be
     Action(Mouse # [Click|DoubleClick|Move [N|S|E|W]]) command and
     Action(Key code [moderators]) command.

 * 060396: Fixed line continuation in the man page, thanks to Romano Giannetti
   <romano@iet.unipi.it> for pointing it out.

 * 060396: Swallow changes! There is a new flag UseTitle, which must be used
   if you want the button to get the window title as it's title. It will no
   longer automatically overwrite. This is not backwards compatible though.
   Also there is a change of syntax, all swallow flags must now be given with
   the swallow command, like:
     Swallow(NoHints, NoKill, Respawn, UseOld, UseTitle) Hangon Command

 * 060396: When NoKill is set, windows are unswallowed to their original 
   geometry (x,y,width,height,borderwidth). Nice in conjunction with UseOld.
   Note: If you experience _systematic_, _reproducable_ errors with NoKill,
   UseOld, Respawn etc, do not hesitate to report! There are some dustdragons
   around.

 * 060396: Frame now accepts a negative parameter, this causes the frame to
   be inverted for all purposes. Pushing an inverse button makes it stand out
   etc. This duplicates the excellent Variable Relief patch by Gregory
   Lauckhart <gregl@cs.washington.edu>

 * 060396: Did some real updating of the manual page. Even wrote a section
   on the arranging algorithm!

 * 060396: Put in justification of titles, the syntax is now
   "Title[(Left|Right|Center)] string". If the title is too long its tail is
   cut off, unless it is Right justified - then its head goes.
   Now only stacking order is missing before we have it emulate menus with
   icons :-)

 * 060396: Fixed code that stores geometry of a swallowed window, now it 
   really unswallows to same place. Hint: XQueryTree()....

 * 060396: Finally got rid of the annoying problem that swallowed programs
   sometimes managed put a border on themselves after being positioned.
   ResizeRedirectMask to dead ears is like plucking the legs of an insect...

 * 060396: Added option NoSize, which will make the initial size estimate
   skip that button when calculating sizes. A very long title or an almost
   right size icon could ruin you whole setup without it.

Changed since FvwmButtons-020396

 * 030396: Fixed the positioning of large windows, which was thoroughly
   unusable due to a "bug" in button_belongs_to(). Rewrite touched a little
   on ShuffleButtons() too.

 * 040396: Fixed bug that made FvwmButtons crash with BUG: Illegal iconwindow
   if an icon failed to load for some reason.

 * 040396: Added better error messages for GetXPMFile(), also told Xpm to use
   whatever closest colors available if not able to allocate exact ones.

 * 040396: Made it allocate colors through a call to XpmCreateImageFromData()
   to gain from its color closeness algorithms, which gets close colors if no
   space is left in the colormap. Better than crashing :-) Should put all the
   calls together to make it in one go...
   But what to do when not using Xpm?

 * 040396: Fixed bug that messed up icon_w and icon_h when failing to load a
   bitmap, which messed up buttonsizes and made a BadValue when creating the
   main window.

 * 040396: Fixed bug, when a font failed in a subcontainer, it would copy it's
   parents personal font instead of it's public font, probably just a garbage
   pointer. If any subbuttons had titles, it would foul up as above.

 * 040396: Actually, it seems it was this: when a button with both icon and
   title failed to load it's icon, icon_w and icon_h was never initialized,
   but used to calculate button size.
