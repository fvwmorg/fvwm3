This directory contains FVWM XML documentation. It is configured to output
an fvwm.1 man page & a plethora of HTML files - all from the same (XML)
source.

By default, only the man page is generated. If you would like to
generate the HTML documentation, use:

./configure --enable-htmldoc

If you do not want to generate the man page, use:

./configure --disable-mandoc

Once it is built, you should be able to point your web browser to:

file:///usr/local/share/doc/fvwm/index.html

(Change "/usr/local" if you use ./configure --prefix="...".)

For developers, the XML source files supersede the old fvwm man page.
Please make any documentation changes here & NOT in the fvwm/fvwm.1.in
file.

If you are editing the documentation for an FVWM command, you will
find an XML file relating to that command in the doc/command/ directory.
Any other documentation changes (eg. general description) will most
likely need to be made in the doc/fvwm directory.

The XML syntax is intuitive - a cursory inspection of a few XML
files should suffice to allow even a novice user to make their changes.
However, there are a few idiosyncrasies worth pointing out:

* Use <fvwmref cmd="Command"/> when referring to an FVWM command. eg:

  <fvwmref cmd="Style"/>

  This will create a link to the Style command (in HTML output).
  Caveat: don't use <fvwmref> to reference commands that are actually
  being described. ie. In the Style.xml file, you won't see any
  <fvwmref>s to the Style command.
* Use <fvwmref cmd="Command" opt="Option"/> when _referring_ to an FVWM
  command option. eg:

  <fvwmref cmd="Style" opt="Font/>

  This will create a link to the Font option of the Style command.
* Use <fvwmopt cmd="Command" opt="Option"> when _describing_ an
  option to a command. eg:

	<fvwmopt cmd="Style" opt="Font"/>
  This will highlight the option name & allow the option to be
  referenced elsewhere.
* Use <fvwmref mod="Module"/> when referring to an FVWM module. eg:

  <fvwmref mod="FvwmPager"/>

  This will create a link to the FvwmPager module (in HTML output).
* Use <fvwmref sect="filename" opt="option" name="text"/> when refering
  to a different section.

  <fvwmref sect="colorGradients" opt="color_gradients" name="Color Gradients"/>

* Use <htmlonly> to wrap text that should only appear in HTML output.
* Use <manonly> to wrap text that should only only appear in man-page output.
* Use <filename> for filenames.
* Use <envar> for environment variables.
* Use <ulink> for links to web pages.
* Use <acronym> for acronyms.
* Use <emphasis> for key names.
