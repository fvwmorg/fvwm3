Fvwm3 Documentation
===================

The old docbook formatted files have been replaced in favour of using
`asciidoc` -- specifically via `asciidoctor` (https://asciidoctor.org).
Unlike previous efforts, `asciidoctor` is now used to generate every man page
-- including modules.

For more information about the specific markup available, see:

* https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/
* https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/

To add additional documents, see:

	doc/fvwm3/*.adoc
	doc/modules/*.adoc

Documentation for modules now resides under `doc/`, rather than its own
module.
