== DESCRIPTION

Fvwm is a window manager for X11 optimised for speed.

Fvwm is intended to have a small memory footprint and is extremely
customizable and extendible.  A large _virtual desktop_ and
_multiple disjoint desktops_ can be used separately or together.
The virtual desktop pretends that the video screen is really quite
large, and you can scroll around within the desktop.  The multiple
disjoint desktops pretend there are really several screens to work
at, but each screen is completely unrelated to the others.

Fvwm provides _keyboard accelerators_ that allow one to perform practically
all window manager functions, including moving and resizing windows and
operating the menus, using keyboard shortcuts.

Fvwm does not distinguish between configuration and action commands.
Configuration commands typically set fonts, colors, menu contents, and
key and mouse function bindings, while action commands do things like
raising and lowering windows. Fvwm makes no such distinction and allows
anything to be changed at any time.

== OPTIONS

These are the command line options that are recognized by fvwm:

*-i* | *--clientid* _id_::

This option is used when fvwm is started by a session manager. Should
not be used by a user.

*-c* | *--cmd* _config-command_::

Causes fvwm to use _config-command_ instead of '*Read* _config_' (or
'*Read* _.fvwm2rc_') as its initialization command. (Note that up to 10
*-f* and *-c* parameters can be given, and they are executed in the
order specified.)
+
Any module started by command line arguments is assumed to be a module
that sends back config commands. All command line modules have to quit
before fvwm proceeds on to the StartFunction and setting border
decorations and styles. There is a potential deadlock if you start a
module other than *FvwmPerl* but there is a timeout
so fvwm eventually gets going.
+
As an example, starting the pager this way hangs fvwm until the timeout,
but the following should work well:

....
fvwm -c "AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmPager"
....

*-d* | *--display* _displayname_::

Manage the display called _displayname_ instead of the name obtained
from the environment variable _$DISPLAY_.

*-f* _config-file_::

Causes fvwm to read _config-file_ instead of _~/.fvwm/config_ as its
initialization file. _$FVWM_USERDIR_ can also be used to change location
of default user directory _~/.fvwm_.

*-o* _logfile_::

Write log messages to _logfile_.  If _logfile_ is '-', log to the
console.  (Does not turn on logging, see the *-v* option.)

*-h* | *--help*::

A short usage description is printed.

*-r* | *--replace*::

Try to take over from a previously running wm. This does not work unless
the other wm is ICCCM2 2.0 compliant.

*-F* | *--restore* _state-file_::

This option is used when fvwm is started by a session manager. Should
not be used by a user.

*-V* | *--version*::

Prints the version of fvwm to _stderr_. Also prints an information about
the compiled in features as stated at compiletime.

*-C* | *--visual* _visual-class_::

Causes fvwm to use _visual-class_ for the window borders and menus.
_visual-class_ can be "StaticGray", "GrayScale", "StaticColor",
"PseudoColor", "TrueColor" or "DirectColor".

*-I* | *--visualid* _id_::

Causes fvwm to use _id_ as the visual id for the window borders and
menus. _id_ can be specified as N for decimal or 0xN for hexadecimal.
See man page of xdpyinfo for a list of supported visuals.

*-l* | *--color-limit* _limit_::

Specifies a _limit_ on the colors used in image, gradient and possibly
simple colors used by fvwm. In fact, fvwm (and all the modules) uses a
palette with at most _limit_ colors. This option is only useful with
screens that display 256 colors (or less) with a dynamic visual
(PseudoColor, GrayScale or DirectColor). The default depends on your X
server and how you run fvwm. In most case this default is reasonable.
The *-l* option should be used only if you encounter problems with
colors. By default, fvwm tries to detect large pre-allocated palettes.
If such a palette is detected fvwm uses it and a priori the *-l* must
not be used. Moreover, in this case the *-A* and *-S* options are
forced. Note that XFree-4.2 pre-allocates 244 colors (if you use a
driver with Render support) leaving only a few free colors. This may
lead to some color problems (and nothing can be done). XFree-4.3 or
better pre-allocate only 85 colors. If no pre-allocated palette is auto
detected the defaults are as follow:
+
Display depth 8 (256 colors)
+
....
PseudoColor: 68 (4x4x4 color cube + 4 grey)
GrayScale: 64 regular grey
DirectColor: 32 (3x3x3 color cube + 5 grey)
....
+
Display depth 4 (16 colors)
+
....
PseudoColor: 10 (2x2x2 color cube + 2 grey)
GrayScale: 8 regular grey
DirectColor: 10 (2x2x2 color cube + 2 grey)
....
+
Note that if you use a private color map (i.e., fvwm is started with the
*-C* or the *-I* options), then other defaults are used.
+
Now what to do if you encounter problems with colors? The first thing to
do is to check if you really cannot run your X server with depth 15, 16
or better. Check your X server documentation. Note that some hardware
can support two different depths on the same screen (typically depth 8
and depth 24). If depth 8 is the default, you can force fvwm to use the
best depth by using the *-C* option with _TrueColor_ as argument. So now
we assume that you are forced to run in depth 8 with a dynamic visual
because your hardware/driver cannot do better or because you need to use
an application which needs to run under this mode (e.g., because this
application needs read-write colors). What it should be understand is
that you have only 256 colors and that all the applications which use
the default color map must share these colors. The main problem is that
there are applications which use a lot or even all the colors. If you
use such application you may have no more free colors and some
applications (which used only a few colors) may fail to start or are
unusable. There are three things that can be done (and fvwm does not
really play a particular role, all applications are concerned). The
first is to run the applications which waste your (default) color map
with a private color map. For example, run netscape with the -install
option, run KDE or QT applications with the --cmap option, use the *-C*
option for fvwm. The disadvantage of this method is that it is visually
disturbing (see the *ColormapFocus* command for a better control of the
color maps switching). The second method is to limit the number of
colors that the applications use. Again, some applications have options
to specify a given color limit. With fvwm you may try various values, 61
(a special "visual" palette), 56 (a 4x4x3 color cube plus 6 grey), 29 (a
3x3x3 color cube plus 2 grey), 10 or 9. Also, you may use the *-L*
option. However, limiting the number of colors is not the definitive
solution. The definitive solution is to try cause applications which use
a lot of colors use the same colors. This is a difficult task as there
are no formal standards for this goal. However, some toolkits as QT and
GTK use color cubes as palettes. So, the idea is to configure your
applications/toolkits to all use the same color cube. Moreover, you can
use the colors in this color cube in your X resources configuration
files and/or as arguments to colors options. Fvwm can use any color cube
of the form RxGxB with 2 <= R <= 6, R = G, R-1 =< B <= R and B >= 2. To
get an RxGxB color cube give an argument to *-l* an integer c >= R*G*B
and < (R+1)*(G+1)*B if B=R and < R*G*(B+1) if B < R (and different from
61). If c > R*G*B, then some grey may be added to the color cube. You
can use the *PrintInfo* _Colors_ [_1_] command to get information on
your fvwm colors setting. In particular, this command prints the palette
used by fvwm in rgb format (the last integer gives the number of times
fvwm has allocated the colors).

*-L* | *--strict-color-limit*::

If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a dynamic visual,
causes fvwm to use its palette for all the colors. By default, the
palette is used only for images and gradients.

*-P* | *--visual-palette*::

If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a dynamic visual,
this option causes fvwm to use a palette designed for limiting the
"visual" color distance between the points of the palette. Moreover, for
better color sharing, if possible colors with a name in the X rgb data
base are used for defining the colors (with the hope that applications
and images prefer to use named colors). If the *-l* option is not used
this palette has 61 colors. This palette is also automatically selected
if 61 or 9 is used as argument to the *-l* option.

*-A* | *--allocate-palette*::

If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a dynamic visual
this option causes fvwm to allocate all the colors of its palette at
start up for reserving these colors for future use. This option forces
the *-static-palette* option. By default, fvwm allocates (reserves) a
color in its palette only if it needs this color.

*-S* | *--static-palette*::

If the screen displays 256 colors (or less) and has a dynamic visual
this option causes fvwm to never free the colors in its palette. By
default, when fvwm does not need a color any more it frees this color so
that a new color can be used. This option may speed up image loading and
save a few bits of memory.

*--debug-stack-ring*::

Enables stack ring debugging. This option is only intended for internal
debugging and should only be used by developers.

*-v* | *--verbose*::

Enables debug logging. Writes in append mode to fvwm log file, which is
~/.fvwm/fvwm3-output.log by default. See ENVIRONMENT section on how to
override this location on fvwm3 startup using _$FVWM_USERDIR_ or
_$FVWM3_LOGFILE_ .
+
Logging can also be dynamically toggled on and off using signals:
+
....
SIGUSR1 : used as a signal to restart Fvwm
SIGUSR2 : used as a signal to toggle opening/closing debug log file
....

== ANATOMY OF A WINDOW

Fvwm puts a decorative border around most windows. This border consists
of a bar on each side and a small L-shaped section on each corner. There
is an additional top bar called the title-bar which is used to display
the name of the window. In addition, there are up to 10 title-bar
buttons. The top, side, and bottom bars are collectively known as the
side-bars. The corner pieces are called the frame.

With the built-in minimal configuration, dragging mouse button 1 in the
frame or side-bars begins a resize operation on the window. Dragging
mouse button 2 in the frame or side-bars begins a move operation. There
are raise/lower operations bound to a single clicking on borders.
Similarly for the window title.

Up to ten title-bar buttons may exist. Their use is completely user
definable. One popular configuration uses one button on the left that is
used to bring up a list of window options and two buttons on the right
used to iconify and maximize the window. Another popular configuration
adds a close button to the right. The number of title-bar buttons used
depends on which ones have mouse actions bound to them. See the *Mouse*
command.

== THE VIRTUAL DESKTOP

Fvwm provides multiple virtual desktops for users who wish to use them.
The screen is a viewport onto a _desktop_ which may be larger than the
screen. Several distinct desktops can be accessed (concept: one desktop
for each project, or one desktop for each application, when view
applications are distinct). Since each desktop can be larger than the
physical screen, divided into m by n _pages_ which are each the size of
the physical screen, windows which are larger than the screen or large
groups of related windows can easily be viewed.

The (m by n) size (i.e. number of pages) of the virtual desktops can be
changed any time, by using the *DesktopSize* command. All virtual
desktops must be (are) the same size. The total number of distinct
desktops does not need to be specified, but is limited to approximately
4 billion total. All windows on a range of desktops can be viewed in the
*FvwmPager*, a miniature view of the desktops. The pager is an accessory
program, called a module, which is not essential for the window manager
to operate. Windows may also be listed using the *WindowList* command or
the *FvwmIconMan* module.

Fvwm keeps the windows on the desktop in a layered stacking order; a
window in a lower layer never obscures a window in a higher layer. The
layer of a window can be changed by using the *Layer* command. The
concept of layers is a generalization of the _StaysOnTop_ flag of older
fvwm versions. The _StaysOnTop_ and _StaysPut_ *Style* options are now
implemented by putting the windows in suitable layers and the previously
missing _StaysOnBottom_ *Style* option has been added.

_Sticky_ windows are windows which transcend the virtual desktop by
"Sticking to the screen's glass". They always stay put on the screen.
This is convenient for things like clocks and xbiffs, so you only need
to run one such gadget and it always stays with you. Icons can also be
made to stick to the glass, if desired.

Window geometries are specified relative to the current viewport. That
is:

....
xterm -geometry +0+0
....

creates a window in the upper left hand corner of the visible portion of
the screen. It is permissible to specify geometries which place windows
on the virtual desktop, but off the screen. For example, if the visible
screen is 1000 by 1000 pixels, and the desktop size is 3x3, and the
current viewport is at the upper left hand corner of the desktop,
invoking:

....
xterm -geometry +1000+1000
....

places a window just off of the lower right hand corner of the screen.
It can be found by moving the mouse to the lower right hand corner of
the screen and waiting for it to scroll into view. A geometry specified
as something like:

....
xterm -geometry -5-5
....

places the window's lower right hand corner 5 pixels from the lower
right corner of the visible portion of the screen. Not all applications
support window geometries with negative offsets. Some applications place
the window's upper right hand corner 5 pixels above and to the left of
the upper left hand corner of the screen; others may do just plain
bizarre things.

There is a fvwm-specific extension to geometry strings which can also
enforce the geometry is relative to the given screen.  For example:

....
xterm -geometry +0+0@n
....

Where 'n' can be one of a RandR monitor name, or an assigned monitor number.
For more details, see the RANDR SUPPORT section.

There are several ways to cause a window to map onto a desktop or page
other than the currently active one. The geometry technique mentioned
above (specifying x,y coordinates larger than the physical screen size),
however, suffers from the limitation of being interpreted relative to
the current viewport: the window may not consistently appear on a
specific page, unless you always invoke the application from the same
page.

A better way to place windows on a different page, screen or desk from
the currently mapped viewport is to use the _StartsOnPage_ or
_StartsOnScreen_ style specification (the successors to the older
_StartsOnDesk_ style) in your _config_ file. The placement is
consistent: it does not depend on your current location on the virtual
desktop.

Some applications that understand standard Xt command line arguments and
X resources, like xterm and xfontsel, allow the user to specify the
start-up desk or page on the command line:

....
xterm -xrm "*Desk:1"
....

starts an xterm on desk number 1;

....
xterm -xrm "*Page:3 2 1"
....

starts an xterm two pages to the right and one down from the upper left
hand page of desk number 3. Not all applications understand the use of
these options, however. You could achieve the same results with the
following lines in your _.Xdefaults_ file:

....
XTerm*Desk: 1
....

or

....
XTerm*Page: 3 2 1
....

== RANDR MULTI-SCREEN SUPPORT

Fvwm best supports multiple screens using the RandR X11 protocol. If
fvwm isn't built with the RandR protocol then the multi screen support
is very limited, and it is suggested to rebuild with RandR. It is also
recommended to use 'EdgeScroll 0 0' on multi-screen displays to avoid
changing pages when moving the mouse between screens.

If Fvwm has been compiled with RandR support then it tracks the outputs
(displays) which it finds. These outputs are stored by name, which can be
found by running using the xrandr(1) command.

When Fvwm detects monitors, it adds them to a tree with a defined order, and
each monitor is assigned a number.  That order is top-down, left-to-right, so
for example, the following diagram illustrates a monitor layout and their
assigned number.

....
A (0)
B (1)   C (2)    D (3)
....

Hence it is possible to then refer to the 2nd monitor and print its name via
expansion variables as:

....
$[monitor.1.name]
....

Which would print the name, *B*.

In doing so, Fvwm tracks events from RandR, such as when a given output
changes size, or has been added or removed.

In addition to specific *FvwmEvent* conditions which can be used to track a
monitor's change, there is a function called _RandRFunc_ which the user can
define to be run when a screen event occurs (such as
enabling/disabling/resolution change):

....
DestroyFunc RandRFunc
AddToFunc   RandRFunc
+ I Exec exec xmessage "A screen changed"
....

== DESKTOP BEHAVIOUR

Because Fvwm has the capability to track outputs, Fvwm can be told how
to handle those. This is controlled via the *DesktopConfiguration*
command. By default, Fvwm treats all outputs it finds as one large
screen, although Fvwm can be told to treat screens independently of each
other.

== INITIALIZATION

During initialization, fvwm searches for a configuration file which
describes key and button bindings, and many other things. The format of
these files is described later. Fvwm first searches for configuration
files using the command

....
Read config
....

This looks for file _config_ in _$FVWM_USERDIR_ and _$FVWM_DATADIR_
directories, as described in *Read*. If this fails more files are
queried for backward compatibility. Here is the complete list of all
file locations queried in the default installation (only the first found
file is used):

....
$HOME/.fvwm/config
/usr/local/share/fvwm/config

$HOME/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc
$HOME/.fvwm2rc
/usr/local/share/fvwm/.fvwm2rc
/usr/local/share/fvwm/system.fvwm2rc
/etc/system.fvwm2rc
....

Please note, the last 5 locations are not guaranteed to be supported in
the future.

If a configuration file is not found, the left mouse button, or

or

keys on the root window bring up menus and forms that can create a
starting configuration file.

Fvwm sets two environment variables which are inherited by its children.
These are _$DISPLAY_ which describes the display on which fvwm is
running. _$DISPLAY_ may be _unix:0.0_ or _:0.0_, which doesn't work too
well when passed through ssh to another machine, so _$HOSTDISPLAY_ is
set to a network-ready description of the display. _$HOSTDISPLAY_ always
uses the TCP/IP transport protocol (even for a local connection) so
_$DISPLAY_ should be used for local connections, as it may use
Unix-domain sockets, which are faster.

If you want to start some applications or modules with fvwm, you can
simply put

....
Exec app
....

or

....
Module FvwmXxx
....

into your _config_, but it is not recommended; do this only if you know
what you are doing. It is usually important to start applications or
modules after the entire config is read, because it contains styles or
module configurations which can affect window appearance and
functionality.

The standard way to start applications or modules on fvwm's start up is
to add them to an initialization function (usually *StartFunction* or
*InitFunction*). This way they are only started after fvwm finishes to
read and execute _config_ file.

Fvwm has three special functions for initialization: *StartFunction*,
which is executed on startups and restarts; *InitFunction* and
*RestartFunction*, which are executed during initialization and restarts
(respectively) just after StartFunction. These functions may be
customized in a user's _config_ file using the *AddToFunc* command
(described later) to start up modules, xterms, or whatever you'd like to
have started by fvwm.

Fvwm has also a special exit function: *ExitFunction*, executed when
exiting or restarting before actually quitting. It could be used to
explicitly kill modules, etc.

If fvwm is run under a session manager, functions *SessionInitFunction*
and *SessionRestartFunction* are executed instead of InitFunction and
RestartFunction. This helps to define the user's _config_ file to be
good for both running under a session manager and without it. Generally
it is a bad idea to start xterms or other applications in "Session*"
functions. Also someone can decide to start different modules while
running under a session manager or not. For the similar purposes
*SessionExitFunction* is used instead of ExitFunction.

....
DestroyFunc StartFunction
AddToFunc StartFunction
 + I Module FvwmPager * *
 + I Module FvwmButtons

DestroyFunc InitFunction
AddToFunc InitFunction
 + I Module FvwmBanner
 + I Module FvwmIconMan
 + I Exec xsetroot -solid cyan
 + I Exec xterm
 + I Exec netscape

DestroyFunc RestartFunction
AddToFunc RestartFunction
 + I Module FvwmIconMan

DestroyFunc SessionInitFunction
AddToFunc SessionInitFunction
 + I Module FvwmBanner

DestroyFunc SessionRestartFunction
AddToFunc SessionRestartFunction
 + I Nop
....

You do not need to define all special functions if some are empty. Also
note, all these special functions may be emulated now using
*StartFunction* and *ExitFunction,* like this:

....
DestroyFunc StartFunction
AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I Test (Init) Module FvwmBanner
+ I Module FvwmPager * *
+ I Test (Restart) Beep

DestroyFunc ExitFunction
AddToFunc ExitFunction
+ I Test (Quit) Echo Bye-bye
+ I KillModule MyBuggyModule
+ I Test (ToRestart) Beep
....

== COMPILATION OPTIONS

Fvwm has a number of compile-time options. If you have trouble using a
certain command or feature, check to see if support for it was included
at compile time. Optional features are described in the _config.h_ file
that is generated during compilation.

== ICONS AND IMAGES

Fvwm can load *.xbm,* *.xpm,* *.png* and *.svg* images. *XBM* images are
monochrome. Fvwm can always display *XBM* files. *XPM* and *PNG* formats
are color images. SVG is a vector graphics image format. Compile-time
options determine whether fvwm can display *XPM*, *PNG* or *SVG* icons
and images. See the _INSTALL.fvwm_ file for more information.

The related *SHAPE* compile-time option can make fvwm display spiffy
shaped icons.

=== SVG rendering options

SVG images are generated from (XML) text files. A really simple SVG file
might look something like this:

....
<svg width="120" height="80">
<rect fill="red"     width="40" height="40"  x="0"   y="0"  />
<rect fill="lime"    width="40" height="40"  x="40"  y="0"  />
<rect fill="blue"    width="40" height="40"  x="80"  y="0"  />
<rect fill="cyan"    width="40" height="40"  x="0"   y="40" />
<rect fill="magenta" width="40" height="40"  x="40"  y="40" />
<rect fill="yellow"  width="40" height="40"  x="80"  y="40" />
</svg>
....

By default, SVG images are rendered as the image creator intended them
to. But since SVG is a vector graphics format, the images can be
rendered at any chosen size and rotation, e.g. making it possible to use
the same icon file rendered at different sizes for the _Icon_ and
_MiniIcon_ styles.

The rendering options are specified as a string appended to the SVG
filename as follows:

....
_image.svg_:[!] [(1) _size_] [(2) _position_] [(3) _rotation_] [(4)
_scale_] ...

{empty}(1) [-]_width_{x}[-]_height_

{empty}(2) {- | +}_xpos_{- | +}_ypos_

{empty}(3) @[-]_angle_

{empty}(4) {* | }[-]_factor_[x | y]
....

The option string always starts with a colon (':') to separate it from
the filename. An empty option string can skip this colon, but it might
still be a good idea to include it to prevent ambiguity if the filename
contains any colon.

....
filename_without_colon.svg
filename:with:colon.svg:
....

An exclamation point ('!') transposes the entire final image (including
the rendering area), i.e. all the horizontal and all the vertical
coordinates are swapped with each other.

....
image.svg:!
....

_width_ and _height_ specifies the dimensions of the rendering area in
pixels, i.e. the dimensions of the resulting image. The actual image is
fitted to fill the entire rendering area.

....
image.svg:60x60
....

Use a _width_ or _height_ value of 0 to keep the aspect ratio.

....
image.svg:0x60
image.svg:60x0
....

A '-' before _width_ mirrors the rendering area horizontally.

....
image.svg:-0x0
....

A '-' before _height_ mirrors the rendering area vertically.

....
image.svg:0x-0
....

_xpos_ and _ypos_ specifies a translation of the image in pixels. A
positive _xpos_ value moves the image to the right. A positive _ypos_
value moves it down. Moving it partially outside of the rendering area
results in a cropped image.

....
image.svg:-30-0
image.svg:-0+10
image.svg:-30+10
....

_angle_ specifies a rotation around the actual image center in degrees.
This might result in a cropped image. A positive value rotates the image
clockwise. Floating point values are recognized.

....
image.svg:@180
image.svg:@-90
image.svg:@30
image.svg:@57.3
....

_factor_ specifes a scaling of the actual image (not the rendering
area). Scaling it up results in a cropped image. Floating point values
are recognized. Division by zero is ignored. If _factor_ is directly
followed by a 'x' or a 'y', the scaling is horizontal or vertical
respectively. Otherwise the scaling is uniform.

....
image.svg:*2
image.svg:/2
image.svg:/3x
image.svg:/2y
....

Scaling down a translated or rotated image can prevent cropping.

....
image.svg:@30*0.6
....

Repeated usage of translation, rotation, and scaling is allowed.
Translation and rotation are additive. Scaling is multiplicative.

....
image.svg:*2/3
image.svg:/3x/2y
....

When combining affine transformations, the scaling is always done first,
then the rotation, and finally the translation.

....
image.svg:-30+10@30/3x/2y
....

Use a negative scale _factor_ to mirror the actual image.

....
image.svg:-30+10@30/-3x/2y
....

Mirroring of the rendering area is done after any scaling, rotation or
translation of the image.

....
image.svg:-0x0-30+10@30/3x/2y
....

Transposing is done last of all, after everything else.

....
image.svg:!-0x0-30+10@30/3x/2y
....

== MODULES

A module is a separate program which runs as a separate Unix process but
transmits commands to fvwm to execute. Users can write their own modules
to do any weird or bizarre manipulations without bloating or affecting
the integrity of fvwm itself.

Modules must be spawned by fvwm so that it can set up two pipes for fvwm
and the module to communicate with. The pipes are already open for the
module when it starts and the file descriptors for the pipes are
provided as command line arguments.

Modules can be spawned by fvwm at any time during the X session by use
of the *Module* command. Modules can exist for the duration of the X
session, or can perform a single task and exit. If the module is still
active when fvwm is told to quit, then fvwm closes the communication
pipes and waits to receive a SIGCHLD from the module, indicating that it
has detected the pipe closure and has exited. If modules fail to detect
the pipe closure fvwm exits after approximately 30 seconds anyway. The
number of simultaneously executing modules is limited by the operating
system's maximum number of simultaneously open files, usually between 60
and 256.

Modules simply transmit commands to the fvwm command engine. Commands
are formatted just as in the case of a mouse binding in the _config_
setup file. Certain auxiliary information is also transmitted, as in the
sample module *FvwmButtons*.

Please refer to the *Module Commands* section for details.

== ICCCM COMPLIANCE

Fvwm attempts to be ICCCM 2.0 compliant. Check
http://tronche.com/gui/x/icccm/ for more info. In addition, ICCCM
states that it should be possible for applications to receive any
keystroke, which is not consistent with the keyboard shortcut approach
used in fvwm and most other window managers. In particular you cannot
have the same keyboard shortcuts working with your fvwm and another fvwm
running within Xnest (a nested X server running in a window). The same
problem exists with mouse bindings.

The ICCCM states that windows possessing the property

....
WM_HINTS(WM_HINTS):
Client accepts input or input focus: False
....

should not be given the keyboard input focus by the window manager.
These windows can take the input focus by themselves, however. A number
of applications set this property, and yet expect the window manager to
give them the keyboard focus anyway, so fvwm provides a window style,
_Lenience_, which allows fvwm to overlook this ICCCM rule. Even with
this window style it is not guaranteed that the application accepts
focus.

The differences between ICCCM 1.1 and 2.0 include the ability to take
over from a running ICCCM 2.0 compliant window manager; thus

....
fvwm; vi ~/.fvwm/config; fvwm -replace
....

resembles the *Restart* command. It is not exactly the same, since
killing the previously running wm may terminate your X session, if the
wm was started as the last client in your _.Xclients_ or _.Xsession_
file.

Further additions are support for client-side colormap installation (see
the ICCCM for details) and the urgency hint. Clients can set this hint
in the WM_HINTS property of their window and expect the window manager
to attract the user's attention to the window. Fvwm has two re-definable
functions for this purpose, "UrgencyFunc" and "UrgencyDoneFunc", which
are executed when the flag is set/cleared. Their default definitions
are:

....
AddToFunc UrgencyFunc
 + I Iconify off
 + I FlipFocus
 + I Raise
 + I WarpToWindow !raise 5p 5p
AddToFunc UrgencyDoneFunc
 + I Nop
....

== EXTENDED WINDOW MANAGER HINTS

Fvwm attempts to respect the extended window manager hints (ewmh or EWMH
for short) specification:
https://specifications.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-1.3.html and
some extensions of this specification.

This support is configurable with styles and commands. These styles and
commands have EWMH as the prefix (so you can find them easily in this
man page).

There is a new Context 'D' for the *Key*, *PointerKey*, *Mouse*
commands. This context is for desktop applications (such as kdesktop and
Nautilus desktop).

When a compliant taskbar asks fvwm to activate a window (typically when
you click on a button which represents a window in such a taskbar), then
fvwm calls the complex function *EWMHActivateWindowFunc* which by
default is Iconify Off, Focus and Raise. You can redefine this function.
For example:

....
DestroyFunc EWMHActivateWindowFunc
AddToFunc EWMHActivateWindowFunc I Iconify Off
+ I Focus
+ I Raise
+ I WarpToWindow 50 50
....

additionally warps the pointer to the center of the window.

The EWMH specification introduces the notion of Working Area. Without
ewmh support the Working Area is the full visible screen (or all your
screens if you have a multi head setup with RandR). However, compliant
applications (such as a panel) can ask to reserve space at the edge of
the screen. If this is the case, the Working Area is your full visible
screen minus these reserved spaces. If a panel can be hidden by clicking
on a button the Working Area does not change (as you can unhide the
panel at any time), but the Dynamic Working Area is updated: the space
reserved by the panel is removed (and added again if you pop up the
panel). The Dynamic Working Area may be used when fvwm places or
maximizes a window. To know if an application reserves space you can
type "xprop | grep _NET_WM_STRUT" in a terminal and select the
application. If four numbers appear then these numbers define the
reserved space as explained in the *EwmhBaseStruts* command.

== CONFIGURATION

=== Configuration Files

The configuration file is used to describe mouse and button bindings,
colors, the virtual display size, and related items. The initialization
configuration file is typically called _config_ (or _.fvwm2rc_). By
using the *Read* command, it is easy to read in new configuration files
as you go.

Lines beginning with '#' are ignored by fvwm. Lines starting with '*'
are expected to contain module configuration commands (rather than
configuration commands for fvwm itself). Like in shell scripts embedded
newlines in a configuration file line can be quoted by preceding them
with a backslash. All lines linked in this fashion are treated as a
single line. The newline itself is ignored.

Fvwm makes no distinction between configuration commands and action
commands, so anything mentioned in the fvwm commands section can be
placed on a line by itself for fvwm to execute as it reads the
configuration file, or it can be placed as an executable command in a
menu or bound to a mouse button or a keyboard key. It is left as an
exercise for the user to decide which function make sense for
initialization and which ones make sense for run-time.

=== Supplied Configuration

A sample configuration file, is supplied with the fvwm distribution. It
is well commented and can be used as a source of examples for fvwm
configuration. It may be copied from _/usr/local/share/fvwm/config_
file.

Alternatively, the built-in menu (accessible when no configuration file
is found) has options to create an initial config file for the user.

== FONTS

=== Font names and font loading

The fonts used for the text of a window title, icon titles, menus and
geometry window can be specified by using the Font and IconFont *Style*,
the Font *MenuStyle* and the *DefaultFont* commands. Also, all the
Modules which use text have configuration command(s) to specify font(s).
All these styles and commands take a font name as an argument. This
section explains what is a font name for fvwm and which fonts fvwm
loads.

First, you can use what we can call a usual font name, for example,

....
-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--10-100-75-75-m-60-ISO8859-1
-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--10-*
-*-fixed-medium-o-normal--14-*-ISO8859-15
....

That is, you can use an X Logical Font Description (XLFD for short).
Then the "first" font which matches the description is loaded and used.
This "first" font depends of your font path and also of your locale.
Fonts which match the locale charset are loaded in priority order. For
example with


....
-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--10-*
....


if the locale charset is ISO8859-1, then fvwm tries to load a font which
matches

....
-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--10-*-ISO8859-1
....

with the locale charset ISO8859-15 fvwm tries to load

....
-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--10-*-ISO8859-15.
....

A font name can be given as an extended XLFD. This is a comma separated
list of (simple) XLFD font names, for example:

....
-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-*,-*-courier-medium-r-normal--14-*
....

Each simple font name is tried until a matching font with the locale
charset is found and if this fails each simple font name is tried
without constraint on the charset.

More details on the XLFD can be found in the X manual page, the X
Logical Font Description Conventions document (called xlfd) and the
XLoadFont and XCreateFontSet manual pages. Some useful font utilities
are: xlsfonts, xfontsel, xfd and xset.

If you have Xft support you can specify an Xft font name (description)
of a true type (or Type1) font prefixed by "xft:", for example:

....
"xft:Luxi Mono"
"xft:Luxi Mono:Medium:Roman:size=14:encoding=iso8859-1"
....

The "first" font which matches the description is loaded. This first
font depends on the XftConfig configuration file with Xft1 and on the
/etc/fonts/fonts.conf file with Xft2. One may read the Xft manual page
and the fontconfig man page with Xft2. The first string which follows
"xft:" is always considered as the family. With the second example Luxi
Mono is the Family (Other XFree TTF families: "Luxi Serif", "Luxi
Sans"), Medium is the Weight (other possible weights: Light, DemiBold,
Bold, Black), Roman is the slant or the style (other possibilities:
Regular, Oblique, Italic) size specifies the point size (for a pixel
size use pixelsize=), encoding allows for enforce a charset (iso8859-1
or iso10646-1 only; if no encoding is given the locale charset is
assumed). An important parameter is "minspace=bool" where bool is True
or False. If bool is False (the default?) Xft gives a greater font
height to fvwm than if bool is True. This may modify text placement,
icon and window title height, line spacing in menus and *FvwmIdent*,
button height in some fvwm modules ...etc. With a LCD monitor you may
try to add "rgba=mode" where mode is either rgb, bgr, vrgb or vbgr to
enable subpixel rendering. The best mode depends on the way your LCD
cells are arranged. You can pass other specifications in between ":", as
"foundry=foundry_name", "spacing=type" where type can be monospace,
proportional or charcell, "charwidth=integer", "charheight=integer" or
"antialias=bool" where bool is True or False. It seems that these
parameters are not always taken in account.

To determine which Xft fonts are really loaded you can export
XFT_DEBUG=1 before starting fvwm and take a look to the error log. With
Xft2 you may use fc-list to list the available fonts. Anyway, Xft
support is experimental (from the X and the fvwm point of view) and the
quality of the rendering depends on number of parameters (the XFree and
the freetype versions and your video card(s)).

After an Xft font name you can add after a ";" an XLFD font name (simple
or extended) as:

....
xft:Verdana:pixelsize=14;-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-*
....

then, if either loading the Xft font fails or fvwm has no Xft support,
fvwm loads the font "-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-*". This allows
for writing portable configuration files.

=== Font and string encoding

Once a font is loaded, fvwm finds its encoding (or charset) using its
name (the last two fields of the name). fvwm assumes that the strings
which are displayed with this font use this encoding (an exception is
that if an iso10646-1 font is loaded, then UTF-8 is assumed for string
encoding). In a normal situation, (i) a font is loaded by giving a font
name without specifying the encoding, (ii) the encoding of the loaded
font is the locale encoding, and then (iii) the strings in the fvwm
configuration files should use the locale encoding as well as the window
and icon name. With Xft the situation is bit different as Xft supports
only iso10646-1 and iso8859-1. If you do not specify one of these
encodings in the Xft font name, then fvwm does strings conversion using
(iii). Note that with multibyte fonts (and in particular with "CJK"
fonts) for good text rendering, the locale encoding should be the
charset of the font.

To override the previous rules, it is possible to specify the string
encoding in the beginning of a font description as follow:

....
StringEncoding=enc:_full_font_name_
....

where _enc_ is an encoding supported by fvwm (usually font name charset
plus some unicode encodings: UTF-8, USC-2, USC-4 and UTF-16).

For example, you may use an iso8859-1 locale charset and have an
*FvwmForm* in Russian using koi8-r encoding. In this case, you just have
to ask *FvwmForm* to load a koi8-r font by specifying the encoding in
the font name. With a multibyte language, (as multibyte font works well
only if the locale encoding is the charset of the font), you should use
an iso10646-1 font:

....
StringEncoding=jisx0208.1983-0:-*-fixed-medium-r-*-ja-*-iso10646-1
....

or

....
"StringEncoding=jisx0208.1983-0:xft:Bitstream Cyberbit"
....

if your *FvwmForm* configuration uses jisx0208.1983-0 encoding. Another
possibility is to use UTF-8 encoding for your *FvwmForm* configuration
and use an iso10646-1 font:

....
-*-fixed-medium-r-*-ja-*-iso10646-1
....

or

....
"StringEncoding=UTF-8:xft:Bitstream Cyberbit"
....


or equivalently

....
"xft:Bitstream Cyberbit:encoding=iso10646-1"
....

In general iso10646-1 fonts together with UTF-8 string encoding allows
the display of any characters in a given menu, *FvwmForm* etc.

More and more, unicode is used and text files use UTF-8 encoding.
However, in practice the characters used range over your locale charset.
For saving memory (an iso10646-1 font may have a very large number of
characters) or because you have a pretty font without an iso10646-1 charset,
you can specify the string encoding to be UTF-8 and use a font in the locale
charset:

....
StringEncoding=UTF-8:-*-pretty_font-*-12-*
....

In most cases, fvwm correctly determines the encoding of the font.
However, some fonts do not end with valid encoding names. When the font
name isn't normal, for example:

....
-misc-fixed-*--20-*-my_utf8-36
....

you need to add the encoding after the font name using a slash as a
delimiter. For example:


....
MenuStyle * Font -misc-fixed-*--20-*-my_utf8-36/iso10646-1
....

If fvwm finds an encoding, fvwm uses the iconv system functions to do
conversion between encodings. Unfortunately, there are no standards. For
conversion between iso8859-1 and UTF-8: a GNU system uses "ISO-8859-1"
and other systems use "iso881" to define the converters (these two names
are supported by fvwm). Moreover, in some cases it may be necessary to
use machine specific converters. So, if you experience problems you can
try to get information on your iconv implementation ("man iconv" may
help) and put the name which defines the converter between the font
encoding and UTF-8 at the end of the font name after the encoding hint
and a / (another possible solution is to use GNU libiconv). For example
use:

....
Style * Font -misc-fixed-*--14-*-iso8859-1/*/latin1
....

to use latin1 for defining the converter for the iso8859-1 encoding. The
"*" in between the "/" says to fvwm to determine the encoding from the
end of the font name. Use:

....
Style * Font \
-misc-fixed-*--14-*-local8859-6/iso8859-6/local_iso8859_6_iconv
....

to force fvwm to use the font with iso8859-6 as the encoding (this is
useful for bi-directionality) and to use local_iso8859_6_iconv for
defining the converters.

=== Font Shadow Effects

Fonts can be given 3d effects. At the beginning of the font name (or
just after a possible StringEncoding specification) add

....
Shadow=size [offset] [directions]]:
....

_size_ is a positive integer which specifies the number of pixels of
shadow. _offset_ is an optional positive integer which defines the
number of pixels to offset the shadow from the edge of the character.
The default offset is zero. _directions_ is an optional set of
directions the shadow emanates from the character. The _directions_ are
a space separated list of fvwm directions:

_N_, _North_, _Top_, _t_, _Up_, _u_, _-_

_E_, _East_, _Right_, _r_, _Right_, _r_, _]_

_S_, _South_, _Bottom_, _b_, _Down_, _d_, ___

_W_, _West_, _Left_, _l_, _Left_, _l_, _[_

_NE_, _NorthEast_, _TopRight_, _tr_, _UpRight_, _ur_, _^_

_SE_, _SouthEast_, _BottomRight_, _br_, _DownRight_, _dr_, _>_

_SW_, _SouthWest_, _BottomLeft_, _bl_, _DownLeft_, _dl_, _v_

_NW_, _NorthWest_, _TopLeft_, _tl_, _UpLeft_, _ul_, _<_

_C_, _Center_, _Centre_, _._

A shadow is displayed in each given direction. _All_ is equivalent to
all the directions. The default _direction_ is _BottomRight_. With the
_Center_ direction, the shadow surrounds the whole string. Since this is
a super set of all other directions, it is a waste of time to specify
this along with any other directions.

The shadow effect only works with colorsets. The color of the shadow is
defined by using the _fgsh_ option of the *Colorset* command. Please
refer to the *Colorsets* section for details about colorsets.

Note: It can be difficult to find the font, _fg_, _fgsh_ and _bg_ colors
to make this effect look good, but it can look quite good.

== BI-DIRECTIONAL TEXT

Arabic and Hebrew text require bi-directional text support to be
displayed correctly, this means that logical strings should be converted
before their visual presentation, so left-to-right and right-to-left
sub-strings are determined and reshuffled. In fvwm this is done
automatically in window titles, menus, module labels and other places if
the fonts used for displaying the text are of one of the charsets that
require _bidi_ (bi-directional) support. For example, this includes
iso8859-6, iso8859-8 and iso10646-1 (unicode), but not other iso8859-*
fonts.

This bi-directional text support is done using the _fribidi_ library
compile time option, see _INSTALL.fvwm_.

== KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

Almost all window manager operations can be performed from the keyboard
so mouse-less operation should be possible. In addition to scrolling
around the virtual desktop by binding the *Scroll* command to
appropriate keys, *Popup*, *Move*, *Resize*, and any other command can
be bound to keys. Once a command is started the pointer is moved by
using the up, down, left, and right arrows, and the action is terminated
by pressing return. Holding down the Shift key causes the pointer movement to
go in larger steps and holding down the control key causes the pointer movement
to go in smaller steps. Standard emacs and vi cursor movement controls can be
used instead of the arrow keys.

== SESSION MANAGEMENT

Fvwm supports session management according to the X Session Management
Protocol. It saves and restores window position, size, stacking order,
desk, stickiness, shadiness, maximizedness, iconifiedness for all
windows. Furthermore, some global state is saved.

Fvwm doesn't save any information regarding styles, decors, functions or
menus. If you change any of these resources during a session (e.g. by
issuing *Style* commands or by using various modules), these changes are
lost after saving and restarting the session. To become permanent, such
changes have to be added to the configuration file.

== BOOLEAN ARGUMENTS

A number of commands take one or several boolean arguments. These take a
few equivalent inputs: "yes", "on", "true", "t" and "y" all evaluate to
true while "no", "off", "false", "f" and "n" evaluate to false. Some
commands allow "toggle" too which means that the feature is disabled if
it is currently enabled and vice versa.

== BUILTIN KEY AND MOUSE BINDINGS

The following commands are built-in to fvwm:

....
Key Help R A Popup MenuFvwmRoot
Key F1 R A Popup MenuFvwmRoot
Key Tab A M WindowList Root c c NoDeskSort
Key Escape A MC EscapeFunc

Mouse 1 R A Menu MenuFvwmRoot
Mouse 1 T   A FuncFvwmRaiseLowerX Move
Mouse 1 FS  A FuncFvwmRaiseLowerX Resize
Mouse 2 FST A FuncFvwmRaiseLowerX Move

AddToFunc FuncFvwmRaiseLowerX
+ I Raise
+ M $0
+ D Lower
....


The Help and F1 keys invoke a built-in menu that fvwm creates. This is
primarily for new users that have not created their own configuration file.
Either key on the root (background) window pops up an menu to help you get
started.

The Tab key pressed anywhere with the Alt key (same as the key on PC
keyboards) held down pop-ups a window list.

Mouse button 1 on the title-bar or side frame can move, raise or lower a
window.

Mouse button 1 on the window corners can resize, raise or lower a
window.

You can override or remove these bindings. To remove the window list
binding, use this:

....
Key Tab A M -
....

== COMMAND EXECUTION

=== Module and Function Commands

If fvwm encounters a command that it doesn't recognize, it checks to see
if the specified command should have been

....
Function (rest of command)
....

or

....
Module (rest of command)
....

This allows complex functions or modules to be invoked in a manner which
is fairly transparent to the configuration file.

Example: the _config_ file contains the line

....
HelpMe
....

Fvwm looks for an fvwm command called "HelpMe", and fails. Next it looks
for a user-defined complex function called "HelpMe". If no such function
exists, fvwm tries to execute a module called "HelpMe".

=== Delayed Execution of Commands

**Note**: There are many commands that affect look and feel of specific,
some or all windows, like *Style*, *Mouse*, *Colorset*, *TitleStyle* and
many others. For performance reasons such changes are not applied
immediately but only when fvwm is idle, i.e. no user interaction or
module input is pending. Specifically, new *Style* options that are set
in a function are not applied until after the function has completed.
This can sometimes lead to unwanted effects.

To force that all pending changes are applied immediately, use the
*UpdateStyles*, *Refresh* or *RefreshWindow* commands.

== QUOTING

Quotes are required only when needed to make fvwm consider two or more
words to be a single argument. Unnecessary quoting is allowed. If you
want a quote character in your text, you must escape it by using the
backslash character. For example, if you have a pop-up menu called
"Window-Ops", then you do not need quotes:

....
Popup Window-Ops
....

but if you replace the dash with a space, then you need quotes:

....
Popup "Window Ops"
....

The supported quoting characters are double quotes, single quotes and
reverse single quotes. All three kinds of quotes are treated in the same
way. Single characters can be quoted with a preceding backslash. Quoting
single characters works even inside other kinds of quotes.

== COMMAND EXPANSION

Whenever an fvwm command line is executed, fvwm performs parameter
expansion. A parameter is a '$' followed by a word enclosed in brackets
($[...]) or a single special character. If fvwm encounters an unquoted
parameter on the command line it expands it to a string indicated by the
parameter name. Unknown parameters are left untouched. Parameter
expansion is performed before quoting. To get a literal '$' use "$$".

If a command is prefixed with a '-' parameter expansion isn't performed.
This applies to the command immediately following the '-', in which the
expansion normally would have taken place. When uesed together with
other prefix commands it must be added before the other prefix.

Example:

....
Pick -Exec exec xmessage '$[w.name]'
....

opens an xmessage dialog with "$[w.name]" unexpanded.

The longer variables may contain additional variables inside the name,
which are expanded before the outer variable.

In earlier versions of fvwm, some single letter variables were
supported. It is deprecated now, since they cause a number of problems.
You should use the longer substitutes instead.

Example:

....
# Print the current desk number, horizontal page number
# and the window's class (unexpanded here, no window).
Echo $[desk.n] $[page.nx] $[w.class]
....

Note: If the command is called outside a window context, it prints
"$[w.class]" instead of the class name. It is usually not enough to have
the pointer over a window to have a context window. To force using the
window with the focus, the *Current* command can be used:

....
Current Echo $[desk.n] $[page.nx] $[w.class]
....

The parameters known by fvwm are:

$$::
	A literal '$'.

$.::
	The absolute directory of the currently Read file. Intended for creating
	relative and relocatable configuration trees. If used outside of any
	read file, the returned value is '.'.

$0 to $9::
	The positional parameters given to a complex function (a function that
	has been defined with the *AddToFunc* command). "$0" is replaced with
	the first parameter, "$1" with the second parameter and so on. If the
	corresponding parameter is undefined, the "$..." is deleted from the
	command line.

$*::
	All positional parameters given to a complex function. This includes
	parameters that follow after "$9".

$[_n_]::

The _n_:th positional parameter given to a complex function, counting
from 0. If the corresponding parameter is undefined, the "$[_n_]" is
deleted from the command line. The parameter is expanded unquoted.

$[_n_-_m_]::
	The positional parameters given to a complex function, starting with
	parameter _n_ and ending with parameter _m_. If all the corresponding
	parameters are undefined, the "$[...]" is deleted from the command line.
	If only some of the parameters are defined, all defined parameters are
	expanded, and the remaining silently ignored. All parameters are
	expanded unquoted.

$[_n_-]::
	All the positional parameters given to a complex function, starting with
	parameter _n_. If all the corresponding parameters are undefined, the
	"$[...]" is deleted from the command line. All parameters are expanded
	unquoted.

$[*]::
	All the positional parameters given to a complex function. This is
	equivalent of $[0-].

$[version.num]::
	The version number, like "2.6.0".

$[version.info]::
	The version info, which contains the SHA of the latest commit (if
	compiled from git), or "(relesaed)" if a compiled from a release
	tarball.

$[version.line]::
	The first line printed by the --version command line option.

$[vp.x] $[vp.y] $[vp.width] $[vp.height]::
	Either coordinate or the width or height of the current viewport.

$[wa.x] $[wa.y] $[wa.width] $[wa.height]::
	Either coordinate or the width or height of the EWMH working area.

$[dwa.x] $[dwa.y] $[dwa.width] $[dwa.height]::
	Either coordinate or the width or height of the dynamic EWMH working area.

$[desk.n]::
	The current desk number.

$[desk.name<n>]::
	These parameters are replaced with the name of the desktop number <n>
	that is defined with the *DesktopName* command. If no name is defined,
	then the default name is returned.

$[desk.width] $[desk.height]::
	The width or height of the whole desktop, i.e. the width or height
	multiplied by the number of pages in x or y direction.

$[desk.pagesx] $[desk.pagesy]::
	The number of total pages in a desk in x or y direction. This is the
	same as the values set by *DesktopSize*.

$[page.nx] $[page.ny]::
	The current page numbers, by X and Y axes, starting from 0. _page_ is
	equivalent to _area_ in the GNOME terminology.

$[w.id]::
	The window-id (expressed in hex, e.g. 0x10023c) of the window the
	command was called for or "$[w.id]" if no window is associated with the
	command.

$[w.name] $[w.iconname] $[w.class] $[w.resource] $[w.visiblename] $[w.iconfile] $[w.miniiconfile] $[w.iconfile.svgopts] $[w.miniiconfile.svgopts]::
	The window's name, icon name, resource class and resource name, visible
	name, file name of its icon or mini icon defined with the _Icon_ or
	_MiniIcon_ style (including the full path if the file was found on
	disk), and (if fvwm is compiled with SVG support) the icon or mini icon
	svg rendering options (including the leading colon), or unexpanded
	"$[w.<attribute>]" string if no window is associated with the command.
+
Note, the first 5 variables may include any kind of characters, so these
variables are quoted. It means that the value is surrounded by single
quote characters and any contained single quote is prefixed with a
backslash. This guarantees that commands like:
+
....
Style $[w.resource] Icon norm/network.png
....
+
work correctly, regardless of any special symbols the value may contain,
like spaces and different kinds of quotes.
+
In the case of the window's visible name, this is the value returned
from the literal title of the window shown in the titlebar. Typically
this will be the same as $[w.name] once expanded, although in the case
of using _IndexedWindowName_ then this is more useful a distinction, and
allows for referencing the specific window by its visible name for
inclusion in things like *Style* commands.

$[w.x] $[w.y] $[w.width] $[w.height]::
	Either coordinate or the width or height of the current window if it is
	not iconified. If no window is associated with the command or the window
	is iconified, the string is left as is.

$[w.pagex] $[w.pagey]::
	The X or Y page the window is on.

$[w.desk]::
	The number of the desk on which the window is shown. If the window is
	sticky the current desk number is used.

$[w.layer]::
	The layer of the window.

$[w.screen]::
	The screen name the window is on.

$[cw.x] $[cw.y] $[cw.width] $[cw.height]::
	These work like $[w.…] but return the geometry of the client part of the
	window. In other words: the border and title of the window is not taken
	into account.

$[i.x], $[it.x], $[ip.x] $[i.y], $[it.y], $[ip.y] $[i.width], $[it.width], $[ip.width] $[i.height], $[it.height], $[ip.height]::
	These work like $[w.…] but return the geometry of the icon ($[i.…]), the
	icon title ($[it.…]) or the icon picture ($[ip.…]).

$[pointer.x] $[pointer.y]::
	These return the position of the pointer on the screen. If the pointer
	is not on the screen, these variables are not expanded.

$[pointer.wx] $[pointer.wy]::
	These return the position of the pointer in the selected window. If the
	pointer is not on the screen, the window is iconified or no window is
	selected, these variables are not expanded.

$[pointer.cx] $[pointer.cy]::
	These return the position of the pointer in the client portion of the
	selected window. If the pointer is not on the screen, the window is
	shaded or iconified or no window is selected, these variables are not
	expanded.

$[pointer.screen]::
	The screen name the pointer is currently on.
+
This is deprecated; use $[monitor.current] instead.

$[monitor.<n>.x], $[monitor.<n>.y], $[monitor.<n>.width], $[monitor.<n>.height], $[monitor.<n>.desk], $[monitor.<n>.pagex], $[monitor.<n>.pagey] $[monitor.primary], $[monitor.prev_primary], $[monitor.current], $[monitor.prev] $[monitor.output], $[monitor.number] $[monitor.count], $[monitor.<n>.prev_desk], $[monitor.<n>.prev_pagex], $[monitor.<n>.prev_pagey]::
	Returns information about the selected monitor. These can be nested, for
	example: $[monitor.$[monitor.primary].width]
+
<n> should be a valid xrandr(1) output name.
+
"x" returns the monitor's x position; "y" returns the monitor's y
position; "width" returns the monitor's width (in pixels); "height"
returns the monitor's height (in pixels)
+
"number" returns the monitor's position within the tree.  See RANDR SUPPORT.
+
"current" is the same as the deprecated $[screen.pointer] variable; the
monitor which has the mouse pointer.
+
"prev" returns the previously focused monitor, or the empty string if there
isn't one.
+
"count" returns the number of active monitors.
+
"desk" returns the current desk displayed on the referenced monitor.
+
"pagex" returns the X page on the referenced monitor.
+
"pagey" returns the Y page of the referenced monitor.
+
"primary" is the name of the output set as primary via xrandr(1).
+
"prev_primary" is the name of the output which was the previous primary
monitor.
+
"prev_desk" returns the previous desk on the referenced monitor.
+
"prev_pagex" returns the previous X page on the referenced monitor.
+
"prev_pagey" returns the previous Y page on the referenced monitor.

$[screen]::
	The screen number fvwm is running on. Useful for setups with multiple
	screens.

$[screen.count]::
	The total number of screens detected.
+
This is deprecated; use $[monitor.count] instead.

$[fg.cs<n>] $[bg.cs<n>] $[hilight.cs<n>] $[shadow.cs<n>] $[fgsh.cs<n>]::
	These parameters are replaced with the name of the foreground (fg),
	background (bg), hilight (hilight), shadow (shadow), or the font shadow
	(fgsh) color that is defined in colorset <n> (replace <n> with zero or a
	positive integer). For example "$[fg.cs3]" is expanded to the name of
	the foreground color of colorset 3 (in rgb:rrrr/gggg/bbbb form).
+
If .lighten<p> or .darken<p> is appended to the parameters, they are
instead replaced with a color that is lighter or darker than the one
defined in colorset <n> by a percentage value <p> (between 0 and 100).
For example "$[bg.cs3.lighten15]" is expanded to the background color of
colorset 3 and then lightened 15% (in rgb:rrrr/gggg/bbbb form).
+
If .hash is appened to the end the color output will use #rrggbb form
(instead of rgb:rrrr/gggg/bbbb). For example, $[bg.cs3.hash] or
$[bg.cs3.lighten15.hash].
+
Please refer to the *Colorsets* section for details about colorsets.

$[math.+.<x>,<y>] $[math.-.<x>,<y>] $[math.*.<x>,<y>] $[math./.<x>,<y>] $[math.%.<x>,<y>] $[math.^.<x>,<y>]::
	The math expansion variables can be used to do some basic arithmetic
	on the integers <x> and <y>. These expressions can be used to add
	({plus}), subtract (-), multiply ({asterisk}), divide (/), modulus
	(%), and exponentiation ({caret}). This can be useful when computing
	the size of panels or locations of windows relative to a monitor, for
	example $[math.-.$[monitor.$[monitor.primary].height],200] will
	subtract 200 pixels from the height of the primary monitor. These can
	also be nested for more complex operations,
	$[math.{plus}.$[math.{asterisk}.3,5],$[math.-.4,-2]]
	is replaced with 21.
+
The comma in "<x>,<y>" is to allow for a future possibility of using floats.
All operations use C integer mathematics. The result of integer division is
the quotient. The modulus can be used to get the remainder of the integer
division. Note that the C modulus returns negative remainders for negative
values. Finally the exponentiation operation returns 1 if <y> is negative.

$[schedule.last]::
	This is replaced by the id of the last command that was scheduled with
	the *Schedule* command, even if this command was already executed.

$[schedule.next]::
	This is replaced by the id the next command used with *Schedule* will
	get (unless a different id is specified explicitly).

$[cond.rc]::
	The return code of the last conditional command. This variable is only
	valid inside a function and can not be used in a conditional command.
	Please refer to the section *Conditional Commands* in the command list.

$[func.context]::
	The context character of the running command as used in the *Mouse*,
	*Key* or *PointerKey* command. This is useful for example with:
+
....
Mouse 3 FS N WindowShade $$[func.context]
....

$[debuglog.state]::
	Either _0_ (debug log closed) or _1_. Indicates the current state of
	debugging and logging facility.

$[gt._str_]::
	return the translation of _str_ by looking in the current locale
	catalogs. If no translation is found _str_ is returned as is. See the
	*LocalePath* command.

$[infostore._key_]::
	Return the value of the item stored in the InfoStore at the given _key_.
	If no key is present, the unexpanded string is returned.

$[...]::
	If the string within the braces is neither of the above, fvwm tries to
	find an environment variable with this name and replaces its value if
	one is found (e.g. "$[PAGER]" could be replaced by "more"). Otherwise
	the string is left as is.
+
Some examples can be found in the description of the *AddToFunc*
command.

== SCRIPTING AND COMPLEX FUNCTIONS

To achieve the more complex effects, fvwm has a number of commands that
improve its scripting abilities. Scripts can be read from a file with
*Read*, from the output of a command with *PipeRead* or written as a
complex function with the *AddToFunc* command. For the curious, section
7 of the fvwm FAQ shows some real life applications of scripting. Please
refer to the sections *User Functions and Shell Commands* and
*Conditional Commands* for details. A word of warning: during execution
of complex functions, fvwm needs to take all input from the mouse
pointer (the pointer is "grabbed" in the slang of X). No other programs
can receive any input from the pointer while a function is run. This can
confuse some programs. For example, the xwd program refuses to make
screen shots when run from a complex function. To achieve the same
functionality you can use the *Read* or *PipeRead* command instead.

ifdef::fvwm3[]
== MENU CONCEPTS AND COMMANDS

Please refer to the fvwm3menus man page.
endif::[]
ifdef::fvwm3all[]
// BEGIN 'menus'
== MENUS

Before a menu can be opened, it has to be populated with menu items
using the *AddToMenu* command and bound to a key or mouse button with
the *Key*, *PointerKey* or *Mouse* command (there are many other ways to
invoke a menu too). This is usually done in the configuration file.

Fvwm menus are extremely configurable in look and feel. Even the
slightest nuances can be changed to the user's liking, including the
menu item fonts, the background, delays before popping up sub menus,
generating menus dynamically and many other features. Please refer to
the *MenuStyle* command to learn more.

*Types of Menus*::
There are four slightly different types of menus:
+
Popup menus can appear everywhere on the screen on their own or
attached to a part of a window. The *Popup* command opens popup menus.
If the popup menu was invoked with a mouse button held down, it is
closed when the button is released. The item under the pointer is then
activated and the associated action is executed.
+
Normal menus are very similar command, but slightly transient.
When invoked by clicking a mouse button, they stay open
and can be navigated with no button held. But if invoked by a
button press followed by mouse motion, it behaves exactly like a popup
menu. The *Menu* command creates normal menus.
+
"Sub menus" are menus inside other menus. When a menu item that has the
*Popup* command as its action is selected, the named menu is opened as
a sub menu to the parent. Any type of menu can have sub menus.
+
"Tear off menus" are menus that have been "torn off" their original
context on the desktop like a normal window. They are created from
other menus by certain key presses or mouse sequences or with the
*TearMenuOff* command from inside a menu.

*Menu Anatomy*::
Menus consist of any number of titles which are inactive menu items
that usually appear at the top of the menu, normal items triggering
various actions when selected, separator lines between the items, tear
off bars (a horizontal broken line) that tear off the menu when
selected, and sub menu items indicated with a triangle pointing left
or right, depending on the direction in which the sub menu appears.
All the above menu items are optional.
+
Additionally, if the menu is too long to fit on the screen, the excess
menu items are put in a continuation menu and a sub menu with the
string "More..." is placed at the bottom of the menu. The "More..."
string honors the locale settings.
+
Finally, there may be a picture running up either side of the menu (a
"side bar").

*Menu Navigation*::
Menus are navigated with the keyboard and the mouse.
Many people prefer to use the mouse, but it can be tedious.
Keyboard navigation can be much faster.
While fvwm displays a menu, it can do nothing else. For example, new
windows do not appear before the menu is closed. However, this is not
exactly true for tear off menus. See the *Tear Off Menus* section for
details.

*Mouse Navigation*::
Moving the pointer over a menu selects the item below it. Normally
this is indicated by a 3d border around the item, but not all parts of
a menu can be selected. Pressing any mouse button while a menu is open
by default activates the item below it. Items of a popup menu are also
activated by releasing a held mouse button. In case of an item that
hides a sub menu, the sub menu is displayed if the pointer hovers over
the item long enough or moves close to the triangle indicating the sub
menu. This behaviour can be tuned with menu styles.
+
Scrolling a mouse wheel over a menu either wraps the pointer along the
menu (default), scrolls the menu under the pointer or act as if the
menu was clicked depending on the _MouseWheel_ menu style.
+
Clicking on a selected item activates it - what happens exactly
depends on the type of the item.
+
Clicking on a title, a separator, the side bar, or outside the menu
closes the menu (exception: tear off menus can not be closed this
way). Pressing mouse button 2 over a menu title or activating a tear
off bar creates a tear off menu from the current menu. Clicking on a
normal menu item invokes the command that is bound to it, and clicking
on a sub menu item either closes all open menus and replaces them with
the sub menu or posts the menu (default).
+
Posting menus is meant to ease mouse navigation. Once a sub menu is
posted, only items from that sub menu can be selected. This can be
very useful to navigate the menu if the pointer tends to stray off the
menu. To unpost the menu and revert back to normal operation, either
click on the same sub menu item or press any key.

*Keyboard Navigation*::
Just like with mouse navigation, the item below the pointer is
selected. This is achieved by warping the pointer to the menu items
when necessary. While a menu is open, all key presses are intercepted
by the menu. No other application can get keyboard input (although
this is not the case for tear off menus).
+
Items can be selected directly by pressing a hotkey that can be
configured individually for each menu item. The hotkey is indicated by
underlining it in the menu item label. With the _AutomaticHotkeys_
menu style fvwm automatically assigns hotkeys to all menu items.
+
The most basic keys to navigate through menus are the cursor keys
(move up or down one item, enter or leave a sub menu),
+
(activate item) and
+
(close menu). Numerous other keys can be used to navigate through
menus by default:
+
_Enter_, _Return_, _Space_ activate the current item.
+
_Escape_, _Delete_, _Ctrl-G_ exit the current sequence of menus or
destroy a tear off menu.
+
_J_, _N_, _Cursor-Down_, _Tab_, _Meta-Tab_, _Ctrl-F_, move to the next
item.
+
_K_, _P_, _Cursor-Up_, _Shift-Tab_, _Shift-Meta-Tab_, _Ctrl-B_, move
to the prior item.
+
_L_, _Cursor-Right_, _F_ enter a sub menu.
+
_H_, _Cursor-Left_, _B_ return to the prior menu.
+
_Ctrl-Cursor-Up_, _Ctrl-K_ _Ctrl-P_, _Shift-Ctrl-Meta-Tab_, _Page-Up_
move up five items.
+
_Ctrl-Cursor-Down_, _Ctrl-J_ _Ctrl-N_, _Ctrl-Meta-Tab_ _Page-Down_
move down five items.
+
_Shift-P_, _Home_, _Shift-Cursor-Up_, _Ctrl-A_ move to the first item.
+
_Shift-N_, _End_, _Shift-Cursor-Down_, _Ctrl-E_ move to the last item.
+
_Meta-P_, _Meta-Cursor-Up_, _Ctrl-Cursor-Left_, _Shift-Ctrl-Tab_, move
up just below the next separator.
+
_Meta-N_, _Meta-Cursor-Down_, _Ctrl-Cursor-Right_, _Ctrl-Tab_, move
down just below the next separator.
+
_Insert_ opens the "More..." sub menu if any.
+
_Backspace_ tears off the menu.

*Menu Bindings*::
The keys and mouse buttons used to navigate the menu can be configured
using the *Key* and *Mouse* commands with the special context 'M',
possible combined with 'T' for the menu title, 'I' for other menu
items, 'S' for any border or sidepic, '[' for left border including a
left sidepic, ']' for right border including a right sidepic, '-' for
top border, '\_' for bottom border. The menu context uses its own set
of actions that can be bound to keys and mouse buttons.
These are _MenuClose_, _MenuCloseAndExec_, _MenuEnterContinuation_,
_MenuEnterSubmenu_, _MenuLeaveSubmenu_, _MenuMoveCursor_,
_MenuCursorLeft_, _MenuCursorRight_, _MenuSelectItem_, _MenuScroll_
and _MenuTearOff_.
+
It is not possible to override the key Escape with no modifiers for
closing the menu. Neither is it possible to undefine mouse button 1,
the arrow keys or the enter key for minimal navigation.
+
*MenuClose* exits from the current sequence of menus or destroys a
tear off menu.
+
*MenuCloseAndExec* exits from the current sequence of menus or
destroys a tear off menu and executes the rest of the line as a
command.
+
*MenuEnterContinuation* opens the "More..." sub menu if any.
+
*MenuEnterSubmenu* enters a sub menu.
+
*MenuLeaveSubmenu* returns to the prior menu.
+
*MenuMoveCursor* _n_ [_m_] moves the selection to another item. If the
first argument is zero the second argument specifies an absolute item
in the menu to move the pointer to. Negative items are counted from
the end of the menu. If the first argument is non-zero, the second
argument must be omitted, and the first argument specifies a relative
change in the selected item. The positions may be suffixed with a 's'
to indicate that the items should refer only to the first items after
separators.
+
*MenuCursorLeft* enters a sub menu with the _SubmenusLeft_ menu style,
and returns to the prior menu with the _SubmenusRight_ menu style.
+
*MenuCursorRight* enters a sub menu with the _SubmenusRight_ menu
style, and returns to the prior menu with the _SubmenusLeft_ menu
style.
+
*MenuSelectItem* triggers the action for the menu item.
+
**MenuScroll **__n__ performs menu scrolling according to the
_MouseWheel_ menu style with _n_ items. The distance can be suffixed
with an 's' to indicate the items should refer only to the first items
after separators.
+
*MenuTearOff* turns a normal menu into a "torn off" menu. See *Tear
Off Menus* for details.

*Tear Off Menus*::
A tear off menu is any menu that has been "torn off" the window it was
attached to and pinned to the root window. There are three ways to
tear off a menu: click on the menu title with mouse button 2, press
+
in the menu or activate its tear off bar (a horizontal bar with a
broken line). Tear off bars must be added to the menu as any other
item by assigning them the command *TearMenuOff*.
+
The builtin tear off actions can be overridden by undefining the
builtin menu actions bound to tear off. To remove the builtin mouse
button 2 binding, use:
+
....
Mouse 2 MT A -
....
+
and to remove the builtin backspace binding, use:
+
....
Key Backspace M A -
....
+
See the section *Menu Bindings* for details on how to assign other
bindings for tear off.
+
Note that prior to fvwm 2.5.20 the tear off mouse bindings were
redefined in different way, which no longer work.
+
The window containing the menu is placed as any other window would be.
If you find it confusing to have your tear off menus appear at random
positions on the screen, put this line in your configuration file:
+
....
Style fvwm_menu UsePPosition
....
+
To remove borders and buttons from a tear-off menu but keep the menu
title, you can use
+
....
Style fvwm_menu !Button 0, !Button 1
Style fvwm_menu !Button 2, !Button 3
Style fvwm_menu !Button 4, !Button 5
Style fvwm_menu !Button 6, !Button 7
Style fvwm_menu !Button 8, !Button 9
Style fvwm_menu Title, HandleWidth 0
....
+
A tear off menu is a cross breeding between a window and a menu. The
menu is swallowed by a window and its title is stripped off and
displayed in the window title. The main advantage is that the menu
becomes permanent - activating an item does not close the menu.
Therefore, it can be used multiple times without reopening it. To
destroy such a menu, close its window or press the Escape key.
+
Tear off menus behave somewhat differently than normal menus and
windows. They do not take the keyboard focus, but while the pointer is
over one of them, all key presses are sent to the menu. Other fvwm key
bindings are disabled as long as the pointer is inside the tear off
menu or one of its sub menus. When the pointer leaves this area, all
sub menus are closed immediately. Note that the window containing a
tear off menu is never hilighted as if it had the focus.
+
A tear off menu is an independent copy of the menu it originated from.
As such, it is not affected by adding items to that menu or changing
its menu style.
+
To create a tear off menu without opening the normal menu first, the
option _TearOffImmediately_ can be added to the *Menu* or *Popup*
command.

=== Building menu contents
*AddToMenu* _menu-name_ [_menu-label_ _action_]::
Begins or adds to a menu definition. Typically a menu definition looks
like this:
+
....
AddToMenu Utilities Utilities Title
 + Xterm           Exec  exec xterm -e tcsh
 + Rxvt            Exec  exec rxvt
 + "Remote Logins" Popup Remote-Logins
 + Top             Exec  exec rxvt -T Top -n Top -e top
 + Calculator      Exec  exec xcalc
 + Xman            Exec  exec xman
 + Xmag            Exec  exec xmag
 + emacs           Exec  exec xemacs
 + Mail            MailFunction xmh "-font fixed"
 + ""              Nop
 + Modules         Popup Module-Popup
 + ""              Nop
 + Exit Fvwm       Popup Quit-Verify
....
+
The menu could be invoked via
+
....
Mouse 1 R A Menu Utilities Nop
....
+
or
+
....
Mouse 1 R A Popup Utilities
....
+
There is no end-of-menu symbol. Menus do not have to be defined in a
contiguous region of the _config_ file. The quoted (or first word)
portion in the above examples is the menu label, which appears in the
menu when the user pops it up. The remaining portion is an fvwm
command which is executed if the user selects that menu item. An empty
menu-label ("") and the *Nop* function are used to insert a separator
into the menu.
+
The keywords _DynamicPopUpAction_ and _DynamicPopDownAction_ have a
special meaning when used as the name of a menu item. The action
following the keyword is executed whenever the menu is popped up or
down. This way you can implement dynamic menus. It is even possible to
destroy itself with *DestroyMenu* and the rebuild from scratch. When
the menu has been destroyed (unless you used the _recreate_ option
when destroying the menu), do not forget to add the dynamic action
again.
+
Note: Do not trigger actions that require user interaction. They may
fail and may screw up your menus. See the *Silent* command.
+
*Warning* Do not issue *MenuStyle* commands as dynamic menu actions.
Chances are good that this crashes fvwm.
+
The keyword _Greyed_ will still render the menu item, but will grey it out
making the option unselectable.
+
There are several configurable scripts installed together with fvwm
for automatic menu generation. They have their own man pages. Some of
them, specifically *fvwm-menu-directory* and *fvwm-menu-desktop*, may
be used with _DynamicPopupAction_ to create a directory listing or
GNOME/KDE application listing.
+
Example (File browser):
+
....
# You can find the shell script fvwm_make_browse_menu.sh
# in the utils/ directory of the distribution.
AddToMenu BrowseMenu
+ DynamicPopupAction PipeRead \
'fvwm_make_browse_menu.sh BrowseMenu'
....
+
Example (Picture menu):
+
....
# Build a menu of all .jpg files in
# $HOME/Pictures
AddToMenu JpgMenu foo title
+ DynamicPopupAction Function MakeJpgMenu

AddToFunc MakeJpgMenu
+ I DestroyMenu recreate JpgMenu
+ I AddToMenu JpgMenu Pictures Title
+ I PipeRead 'for i in $HOME/Pictures/*.jpg; \
do echo AddToMenu JpgMenu "`basename $i`" Exec xv $i; done'
....
+
The keyword _MissingSubmenuFunction_ has a similar meaning. It is
executed whenever you try to pop up a sub menu that does not exist.
With this function you can define and destroy menus on the fly. You
can use any command after the keyword, but if the name of an item
(that is a submenu) defined with *AddToFunc* follows it, fvwm executes
this command:
+
....
Function <function-name> <submenu-name>
....
+
i.e. the name is passed to the function as its first argument and can
be referred to with "$0".
+
The *fvwm-menu-directory* script mentioned above may be used with
_MissingSubmenuFunction_ to create an up to date recursive directory
listing.
+
Example:
+
....
# There is another shell script fvwm_make_directory_menu.sh
# in the utils/ directory of the distribution. To use it,
# define this function in your configuration file:

DestroyFunc MakeMissingDirectoryMenu
AddToFunc MakeMissingDirectoryMenu
+ I PipeRead fvwm_make_directory_menu.sh $0

DestroyMenu SomeMenu
AddToMenu SomeMenu
+ MissingSubmenuFunction MakeMissingDirectoryMenu
+ "Root directory" Popup /
....
+
This is another implementation of the file browser that uses sub menus
for subdirectories.
+
Titles can be used within the menu. If you add the option _top_ behind
the keyword *Title*, the title is added to the top of the menu. If
there was a title already, it is overwritten.
+
....
AddToMenu Utilities Tools Title top
....
+
All text up to the first Tab in the menu label is aligned to the left side of
t the menu, all text right of the first is aligned to the left in a second
column and all text thereafter is placed right aligned in the third column.
All other s are replaced by spaces. Note that you can change this format with
the _ItemFormat_ option of the *MenuStyle* command.
+
If the menu-label contains an ampersand ('&'), the next character is
taken as a hot-key for the menu item. Hot-keys are underlined in the
label. To get a literal '&', insert "&&". Pressing the hot-key moves
through the list of menu items with this hot-key or selects an item
that is the only one with this hot-key.
+
If the menu-label contains a sub-string which is set off by stars,
then the text between the stars is expected to be the name of an image
file to insert in the menu. To get a literal '*', insert "**". For
example
+
....
+ Calculator*xcalc.xpm* Exec exec xcalc
....
+
inserts a menu item labeled "Calculator" with a picture of a
calculator above it. The following:
+
....
+ *xcalc.xpm*           Exec exec xcalc
....
+
Omits the "Calculator" label, but leaves the picture.
+
If the menu-label contains a sub-string which is set off by percent
signs, then the text between the percent signs is expected to be the
name of image file (a so called mini icon to insert to the left of the
menu label. A second mini icon that is drawn at the right side of the
menu can be given in the same way. To get a literal '%', insert "%%".
For example
+
....
+ Calculator%xcalc.xpm% Exec exec xcalc
....
+
inserts a menu item labeled "Calculator" with a picture of a
calculator to the left. The following:
+
....
+ %xcalc.xpm%           Exec exec xcalc
....
+
Omits the "Calculator" label, but leaves the picture. The pictures
used with this feature should be small (perhaps 16x16).
+
If the menu-name (not the label) contains a sub-string which is set
off by at signs ('@'), then the text between them is expected to be
the name of an image file to draw along the left side of the menu (a
side pixmap). You may want to use the _SidePic_ option of the
*MenuStyle* command instead. To get a literal '@', insert "@@". For
example
+
....
AddToMenu StartMenu@linux-menu.xpm@
....
+
creates a menu with a picture in its bottom left corner.
+
If the menu-name also contains a sub-string surrounded by '^'s, then
the text between '^'s is expected to be the name of an X11 color and
the column containing the side picture is colored with that color. You
can set this color for a menu style using the _SideColor_ option of
the *MenuStyle* command. To get a literal '^', insert "^^". Example:
+
....
AddToMenu StartMenu@linux-menu.xpm@^blue^
....
+
creates a menu with a picture in its bottom left corner and colors
with blue the region of the menu containing the picture.
+
In all the above cases, the name of the resulting menu is name
specified, stripped of the substrings between the various delimiters.

*DestroyMenu* [recreate] _menu_::
Deletes a menu, so that subsequent references to it are no longer
valid. You can use this to change the contents of a menu during an
fvwm session. The menu can be rebuilt using *AddToMenu*. The optional
parameter _recreate_ tells fvwm not to throw away the menu completely
but to throw away all the menu items (including the title).
+
....
DestroyMenu Utilities
....

*Title*::
	Does nothing. It is used to insert a title line in a popup or menu.

=== Commands that open menus

*Menu* _menu-name_ [_position_] [_double-click-action_]::
Causes a previously defined menu to be popped up in a sticky manner.
That is, if the user invokes the menu with a click action instead of a
drag action, the menu stays up. The command _double-click-action_ is
invoked if the user double-clicks a button (or hits the key rapidly
twice if the menu is bound to a key) when bringing up the menu. If the
double click action is not specified, double clicking on the menu does
nothing. However, if the menu begins with a menu item (i.e. not with a
title or a separator) and the double click action is not given, double
clicking invokes the first item of the menu (but only if the pointer
really was over the item).
+
The pointer is warped to where it was when the menu was invoked if it
was both invoked and closed with a keystroke.
+
The _position_ arguments allow placement of the menu somewhere on the
screen, for example centered on the visible screen or above a title
bar. Basically it works like this: you specify a _context-rectangle_
and an offset to this rectangle by which the upper left corner of the
menu is moved from the upper left corner of the rectangle. The
_position_ arguments consist of several parts:
+
{empty}[_context-rectangle_] _x_ _y_ [_special options_]
+
The _context-rectangle_ can be one of:
+
_Root_:::
	the root window of the current screen.
+
_Monitor_:::
	the area of the current RandR screen.
+
_Mouse_:::
	a 1x1 rectangle at the mouse position.
+
_Window_:::
	the frame of the context window.
+
_Interior_:::
	the inside of the context window.
+
_Title_:::
	the title of the context window or icon.
+
_Button<n>_:::
        button <n> of the context window.
+
_Icon_:::
	the icon of the context window.
+
_Menu_:::
	the current menu.
+
_Item_:::
	the current menu item.
+
_Context_:::
	the current window, menu or icon.
+
_This_:::
	whatever widget the pointer is on (e.g. a corner of a window or the
	root window).
+
_Rectangle_ <_geometry_>:::
	the rectangle defined by <_geometry_> in X geometry format. Width
	and height default to 1 if omitted.
+
If the context-rectangle is omitted or invalid (e.g. "item" on a
window), "Mouse" is the default. Note that not all of these make sense
under all circumstances (e.g. "Icon" if the pointer is on a menu).
+
The offset values _x_ and _y_ specify how far the menu is moved from
its default position. By default, the numeric value given is
interpreted as a percentage of the context rectangle's width (height),
but with a trailing '_m_' the menu's width (height) is used instead.
Furthermore a trailing '_p_' changes the interpretation to mean
pixels.
+
Instead of a single value you can use a list of values. All additional
numbers after the first one are separated from their predecessor by
their sign. Do not use any other separators.
+
If _x_ or _y_ are prefixed with "'__o__<number>" where <number> is an
integer, the menu and the rectangle are moved to overlap at the
specified position before any other offsets are applied. The menu and
the rectangle are placed so that the pixel at <number> percent of the
rectangle's width/height is right over the pixel at <number> percent
of the menu's width/height. So "o0" means that the top/left borders of
the menu and the rectangle overlap, with "o100" it's the bottom/right
borders and if you use "o50" they are centered upon each other (try it
and you will see it is much simpler than this description). The
default is "o0". The prefix "o<number>" is an abbreviation for
"+<number>-<number>m".
+
A prefix of '_c_' is equivalent to "o50". Examples:
+
....
# window list in the middle of the screen
WindowList Root c c

# menu to the left of a window
Menu name window -100m c+0

# popup menu 8 pixels above the mouse pointer
Popup name mouse c -100m-8p

# somewhere on the screen
Menu name rectangle 512x384+1+1 +0 +0

# centered vertically around a menu item
AddToMenu foobar-menu
 + "first item" Nop
 + "special item" Popup "another menu" item +100 c
 + "last item" Nop

# above the first menu item
AddToMenu foobar-menu
 + "first item" Popup "another menu" item +0 -100m
....
+
Note that you can put a sub menu far off the current menu so you could
not reach it with the mouse without leaving the menu. If the pointer
leaves the current menu in the general direction of the sub menu the
menu stays up.
+
_Special options_:::
+
To create a tear off menu without opening the normal menu, add the
option _TearOffImmediately_. Normally the menu opens in normal state
for a split second before being torn off. As tearing off places the
menu like any other window, a position should be specified explicitly:
+
....
# Forbid fvwm to place the menu window
Style <name of menu> UsePPosition
# Menu at top left corner of screen
Menu Root 0p 0p TearOffImmediately
....
+
The _Animated_ and _Mwm_ or _Win_ menu styles may move a menu
somewhere else on the screen. If you do not want this you can add
_Fixed_ as an option. This might happen for example if you want the
menu always in the top right corner of the screen.
+
Where do you want a menu to appear when you click on its menu item?
The default is to place the title under the cursor, but if you want it
where the position arguments say, use the _SelectInPlace_ option. If
you want the pointer on the title of the menu, use _SelectWarp_ too.
Note that these options apply only if the _PopupAsRootMenu_
*MenuStyle* option is used.
+
The pointer is warped to the title of a sub menu whenever the pointer
would be on an item when the sub menu is popped up (_fvwm_ menu style)
or never warped to the title at all (_Mwm_ or _Win_ menu styles). You
can force (forbid) warping whenever the sub menu is opened with the
_WarpTitle_ (_NoWarp_) option.
+
Note that the _special-options_ do work with a normal menu that has no
other position arguments.

*Popup* _PopupName_ [_position_] [_default-action_]::
	This command has two purposes: to bind a menu to a key or mouse
	button, and to bind a sub menu into a menu. The formats for the two
	purposes differ slightly. The _position_ arguments are the same as for
	*Menu*. The command _default-action_ is invoked if the user clicks a
	button to invoke the menu and releases it immediately again (or hits
	the key rapidly twice if the menu is bound to a key). If the default
	action is not specified, double clicking on the menu does nothing.
	However, if the menu begins with a menu item (i.e. not with a title or
	a separator) and the default action is not given, double clicking
	invokes the first item of the menu (but only if the pointer really was
	over the item).
+
To bind a previously defined pop-up menu to a key or mouse button:
+
The following example binds mouse buttons 2 and 3 to a pop-up called
"Window Ops". The menu pops up if the buttons 2 or 3 are pressed in
the window frame, side-bar, or title-bar, with no modifiers (none of
shift, control, or meta).
+

....
Mouse 2 FST N Popup "Window Ops"
Mouse 3 FST N Popup "Window Ops"
....

+
Pop-ups can be bound to keys through the use of the *Key* command.
Pop-ups can be operated without using the mouse by binding to keys and
operating via the up arrow, down arrow, and enter keys.
+
To bind a previously defined pop-up menu to another menu, for use as a
sub menu:
+
The following example defines a sub menu "Quit-Verify" and binds it
into a main menu, called "RootMenu":
+

....
AddToMenu Quit-Verify
 + "Really Quit Fvwm?" Title
 + "Yes, Really Quit"  Quit
 + "Restart Fvwm"      Restart
 + ""                  Nop
 + "No, Don't Quit"    Nop

AddToMenu RootMenu "Root Menu" Title
 + "Open XTerm Window" Popup NewWindowMenu
 + "Login as Root"     Exec exec xterm -T Root -n Root -e su -
 + "Login as Anyone"   Popup AnyoneMenu
 + "Remote Hosts"      Popup HostMenu
 + ""                  Nop
 + "X utilities"       Popup Xutils
 + ""                  Nop
 + "Fvwm Modules"      Popup Module-Popup
 + "Fvwm Window Ops"   Popup Window-Ops
 + ""                  Nop
 + "Previous Focus"    Prev (AcceptsFocus) Focus
 + "Next Focus"        Next (AcceptsFocus) Focus
 + ""                  Nop
 + "Refresh screen"    Refresh
 + ""                  Nop
 + "Reset X defaults"  Exec xrdb -load \
                 $HOME/.Xdefaults
 + ""                  Nop
 + ""                  Nop
 + Quit                Popup Quit-Verify
....

+
Popup differs from *Menu* in that pop-ups do not stay up if the user
simply clicks. These are popup-menus, which are a little hard on the
wrist. *Menu* menus stay up on a click action. See the *Menu* command
for an explanation of the interactive behavior of menus. A menu can be
open up to ten times at once, so a menu may even use itself or any of
its predecessors as a sub menu.

*TearMenuOff*::
When assigned to a menu item, it inserts a tear off bar into the menu
(a horizontal broken line). Activating that item tears off the menu.
If the menu item has a label, it is shown instead of the broken line.
If used outside menus, this command does nothing. Examples:
+
....
AddToMenu WindowMenu
+ I "" TearMenuOff

AddToMenu RootMenu
+ I "click here to tear me off" TearMenuOff
....

=== Menu style commands

Menu styles describe the looks and behaviour like normal styles do
for windows. Menu styles are assigned to individual or all menus,
and changing the menu style immediately affects all menus that use
it.  (If a menu style is used from within a menu, the changes are
applied the next time an affected menu is opened.)

*ChangeMenuStyle* _menustyle_ _menu_ ...::
Changes the menu style of _menu_ to _menustyle_. You may specify more
than one menu in each call of *ChangeMenuStyle*.

*CopyMenuStyle* _orig-menustyle_ _dest-menustyle_::
Copy _orig-menustyle_ to _dest-menustyle_, where _orig-menustyle_ is
an existing menu style. If the menu style _dest_menustyle_ does not
exist, then it is created.

*DestroyMenuStyle* _menustyle_::
Deletes the menu style named _menustyle_ and changes all menus using
this style to the default style, you cannot destroy the default menu
style.
+
....
DestroyMenuStyle pixmap1
....

*MenuStyle* _stylename_ [_options_]::
Sets a new menu style or changes a previously defined style. The
_stylename_ is the style name; if it contains spaces or tabs it has to
be quoted. The name "*" is reserved for the default menu style. The
default menu style is used for every menu-like object (e.g. the window
created by the *WindowList* command) that had not be assigned a style
using the *ChangeMenuStyle*. See also *DestroyMenuStyle*. When using
monochrome color options are ignored.
+
_options_ is a comma separated list containing some of the keywords
Fvwm / Mwm / Win, BorderWidth, HilightBack / !HilightBack, HilightTitleBack,
ActiveFore / !ActiveFore, MenuColorset, ActiveColorset, GreyedColorset,
TitleColorset, Hilight3DThick / Hilight3DThin / Hilight3DOff,
Hilight3DThickness, Animation / !Animation, Font, TitleFont,
PopupDelay, PopupOffset, TitleWarp / !TitleWarp, TitleUnderlines0 /
TitleUnderlines1 / TitleUnderlines2, SeparatorsLong / SeparatorsShort,
TrianglesSolid / TrianglesRelief, PopupImmediately / PopupDelayed,
PopdownImmediately / PopdownDelayed, PopupActiveArea, DoubleClickTime,
SidePic, SideColor, PopupAsRootMenu / PopupAsSubmenu / PopupIgnore /
PopupClose, RemoveSubmenus / HoldSubmenus, SubmenusRight /
SubmenusLeft, SelectOnRelease, ItemFormat, VerticalItemSpacing,
VerticalMargins, VerticalTitleSpacing, AutomaticHotkeys /
!AutomaticHotkeys, UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate /
!UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate, MouseWheel, ScrollOffPage /
!ScrollOffPage, TrianglesUseFore / !TrianglesUseFore,
Translucent / !Translucent.
+
In the above list some options are listed as option pairs or triples
with a '/' in between. These options exclude each other. All paired
options can be negated to have the effect of the counterpart option by
prefixing ! to the option.
+
_Fvwm_, _Mwm_, _Win_ reset all options to the style with the same name
in former versions of fvwm. The default for new menu styles is _Fvwm_
style. These options override all others except _HilightBack_, _ActiveFore_
and _PopupDelay_, so they should be used only as the first option specified
for a menu style or to reset the style to defined behavior. The same effect
can be created by setting all the other options one by one.
+
_Mwm_ and _Win_ style menus popup sub menus automatically. _Win_ menus
indicate the current menu item by changing the background to dark.
_Fvwm_ sub menus overlap the parent menu, _Mwm_ and _Win_ style menus
never overlap the parent menu.
+
_Fvwm_ style is equivalent to !HilightBack, Hilight3DThin,
!ActiveFore, !Animation, Font, PopupOffset 0 67, TitleWarp,
TitleUnderlines1, SeparatorsShort, TrianglesRelief, PopupDelayed,
PopdownDelayed, PopupDelay 150, PopdownDelay 150, PopupAsSubmenu,
HoldSubmenus, SubmenusRight, BorderWidth 2, !AutomaticHotkeys,
UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate, PopupActiveArea 75.
+
_Mwm_ style is equivalent to !HilightBack, Hilight3DThick,
!ActiveFore, !Animation, Font, PopupOffset -3 100,
!TitleWarp, TitleUnderlines2, SeparatorsLong, TrianglesRelief,
PopupImmediately, PopdownDelayed, PopdownDelay 150, PopupAsSubmenu,
HoldSubmenus, SubmenusRight, BorderWidth 2,
UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate, !AutomaticHotkeys, PopupActiveArea 75.
+
_Win_ style is equivalent to HilightBack, Hilight3DOff, ActiveFore,
!Animation, Font, PopupOffset -5 100, !TitleWarp,
TitleUnderlines1, SeparatorsShort, TrianglesSolid, PopupImmediately,
PopdownDelayed, PopdownDelay 150, PopupAsSubmenu, RemoveSubmenus,
SubmenusRight, BorderWidth 2, UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate,
!AutomaticHotkeys, PopupActiveArea 75.
+
_BorderWidth_ takes the thickness of the border around the menus in
pixels. It may be zero to 50 pixels. The default is 2. Using an
invalid value reverts the border width to the default.
+
_HilightBack_ and _!HilightBack_ switch hilighting the background of
the selected menu item on and off. The _ActiveColorset_ background
color is used for the hilighting.
+
_HilightTitleBack_ switches hilighting the background of menu titles
on. The _TitleColorset_ background color is used for the hilighting.
+
_ActiveFore_ and _!ActiveFore_ switch hilighting the foreground of the
selected menu item on and off. The _ActiveColorset_ foreground color
is used for the hilighting.
+
_MenuColorset_ controls the colorset used to color the menu. If the
colorset has a pixmap or gradient defined, this is used as the background
of the menu. The shape mask from the colorset is used to shape the
menu. Please refer to the *Colorsets* section for details about
colorsets.
+
_ActiveColorset_ controls the color of the active menu item, provided
the _HilightBack_ or _ActiveFore_ menu styles are used. If specified,
the hilight and shadow colors from the colorset are used too. The
pixmap and shape mask from the colorset are not used. Hilighting the
background or foreground can be turned off individually with the
_!ActiveFore_ or _!HilightBack_ menu styles.
+
_GreyedColorset_ works exactly like _MenuColorset_, but the foreground
from the colorset replaces the color given with the _Greyed_ menu
style. No other parts of the colorset are used.
+
_TitleColorset_ works exactly like _MenuColorset_, but is used only
for menu titles.
+
_Translucent_ controls a pseudo transparent effect that uses a image
of the desktop under the menu as its background image. This option
takes one value that is a number between 0 (fully translucent)
and 100 (not translucent), which is the percent of the translucency.
Use _!Translucent_ (or no additional value) to turn the effect off.
The translucent effect only applies to normal menus and does not
apply to "torn off" menus. Note, only the menu background is
translucent, the _HilightBack_ of the active item and
_HilightTitleBack_ of the title are not. To have a fully translucent
menu use the following.
+
....
MenuStyle * Translucent 60, !HilightBack, !HilightTitleBack, ActiveFore
....
+
_Hilight3DThick_, _Hilight3DThin_ and _Hilight3DOff_ determine if the
selected menu item is hilighted with a 3D relief. Thick reliefs are
two pixels wide, thin reliefs are one pixel wide.
+
_Hilight3DThickness_ takes one numeric argument that may be between
-50 and +50 pixels. With negative values the menu item gets a pressed
in look. The above three commands are equivalent to a thickness of 2,
1 and 0.
+
_Animation_ and _!Animation_ turn menu animation on or off. When
animation is on, sub menus that do not fit on the screen cause the
parent menu to be shifted to the left so the sub menu can be seen.
+
_Font_ and _TitleFont_ take a font name as an argument. If a font by
this name exists it is used for the text of all menu items. If it does
not exist or if the name is left blank the built-in default is used.
If a _TitleFont_ is given, it is used for all menu titles instead of
the normal font.
+
_PopupDelay_ requires one numeric argument. This value is the delay in
milliseconds before a sub menu is popped up when the pointer moves
over a menu item that has a sub menu. If the value is zero no
automatic pop up is done. If the argument is omitted the built-in
default is used. Note that the popup delay has no effect if the
_PopupImmediately_ option is used since sub menus pop up immediately
then.
+
_PopupImmediately_ makes menu items with sub menus pop up it up as
soon as the pointer enters the item. The _PopupDelay option_ is
ignored then. If _PopupDelayed_ is used fvwm looks at the _PopupDelay_
option if or when this automatic popup happens.
+
_PopdownDelay_ works exactly like _PopupDelay_ but determines the
timeout of the _PopupDelayed_ style.
+
_PopdownImmediately_ makes sub menus vanish as soon as the pointer
leaves the sub menu and the correspondent item in the parent menu.
With the opposite option _PopdownDelayed_ the sub menu only pops down
after the time specified with the _PopdownDelay_ option. This comes
handy when the pointer often strays off the menu item when trying to
move into the sub menu. Whenever there is a conflict between the
_PopupImmediately_, _PopupDelayed_, _PopupDelay_ styles and the
_PopdownImmediately_, _PopdownDelayed_, _PopdownDelay_ styles, the
_Popup..._ styles win when using mouse navigation and the _Popdown..._
styles win when navigating with the keyboard.
+
_PopupOffset_ requires two integer arguments. Both values affect where
sub menus are placed relative to the parent menu. If both values are
zero, the left edge of the sub menu overlaps the left edge of the
parent menu. If the first value is non-zero the sub menu is shifted
that many pixels to the right (or left if negative). If the second
value is non-zero the menu is moved by that many percent of the parent
menu's width to the right or left.
+
_PopupActiveArea_ requires an integer value between 51 and 100.
Normally, when the pointer is over a menu item with a sub menu and the
pointer enters the area that starts at 75% of the menu width, the sub
menu is shown immediately. This percentage can be changed with
_PopupActiveArea_. Setting this value to 100 disables this kind of
automatic popups altogether. The default value is restored if no or an
invalid value is given.
+
_TitleWarp_ and _!TitleWarp_ affect if the pointer warps to the menu
title when a sub menu is opened or not. Note that regardless of this
setting the pointer is not warped if the menu does not pop up under
the pointer.
+
_TitleUnderlines0_, _TitleUnderlines1_ and _TitleUnderlines2_ specify
how many lines are drawn below a menu title.
+
_SeparatorsLong_ and _SeparatorsShort_ set the length of menu
separators. Long separators run from the left edge all the way to the
right edge. Short separators leave a few pixels to the edges of the
menu.
+
_TrianglesSolid_ and _TrianglesRelief_ affect how the small triangles
for sub menus is drawn. Solid triangles are filled with a color while
relief triangles are hollow.
+
_DoubleClickTime_ requires one numeric argument. This value is the
time in milliseconds between two mouse clicks in a menu to be
considered as a double click. The default is 450 milliseconds. If the
argument is omitted the double click time is reset to this default.
+
_SidePic_ takes the name of an image file as an argument. The picture
is drawn along the left side of the menu. The _SidePic_ option can be
overridden by a menu specific side pixmap (see *AddToMenu*). If the
file name is omitted an existing side pixmap is removed from the menu
style.
+
_SideColor_ takes the name of an X11 color as an argument. This color
is used to color the column containing the side picture (see above).
The SideColor option can be overridden by a menu specific side color
(see *AddToMenu*). If the color name is omitted the side color option
is switched off.
+
_PopupAsRootMenu_, _PopupAsSubmenu_, _PopupIgnore_ and _PopupClose_
change the behavior when you click on a menu item that opens a sub
menu. With _PopupAsRootMenu_ the original menu is closed before the
sub menu appears, with _PopupAsSubmenu_ it is not, so you can navigate
back into the parent menu. Furthermore, with _PopupAsSubmenu_ the sub
menu is held open (posted) regardless of where you move the mouse.
Depending on your menu style this may simplify navigating through the
menu. *Any* keystroke while a menu is posted reverts the menu back to
the normal behavior. With _PopupClose_ the menu is closed when a sub
menu item is activated, and the menu stays open if _PopupIgnore_ is
used (even if the menu was invoked with the *Popup* command).
_PopupAsSubmenu_ is the default.
+
_RemoveSubmenus_ instructs fvwm to remove sub menu when you move back
into the parent menu. With _HoldSubmenus_ the sub menu remains
visible. You probably want to use _HoldSubmenus_ if you are using the
_PopupDelayed_ style. _RemoveSubmenus_ affects menu navigation with
the keyboard.
+
_SelectOnRelease_ takes an optional key name as an argument. If the
given key is released in a menu using this style, the current menu
item is selected. This is intended for
*WindowList* navigation. The key name is a standard X11 key name as
defined in _/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h_, (without the _XK__ prefix),
or the keysym database _/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB_. To disable this
behavior, omit the key name.
+
Note: Some X servers do not support KeyRelease events.
_SelectOnRelease_ does not work on such a machine.
+
_ItemFormat_ takes a special string as its argument that determines
the layout of the menu items. Think of the format string as if it were
a menu item. All you have to do is tell fvwm where to place the
different parts of the menu item (i.e. the labels, the triangle
denoting a sub menu, the mini icons and the side pic) in the blank
area. The string consists of spaces,
+
characters and formatting directives beginning with '%'. Any invalid
characters and formatting directives are silently ignored:
+
--
*%l*, *%c* and *%r*:::
	Insert the next item label. Up to three labels can be used. The item
	column is left-aligned (*%l*), centered (*%c*) or right-aligned
	(*%r*).
*%i*:::
	Inserts the mini icon.
*%>* and *%<*:::
	Insert the sub menu triangle pointing either to the right (*%>*) or to
	the left (*%<*).
*%|*:::
	The first *%|* denotes the beginning of the area that is highlighted
	either with a background color or a relief (or both). The second *%|*
	marks the end of this area. *%|* can be used up to twice in the
	string. If you do not add one or both of them, fvwm sets the margins
	to the margins of the whole item (not counting the side picture).
*%s*:::
	Places the side picture either at the beginning or the end of the
	menu. This directive may be used only once and only as the first or
	last in the format string. If the *%s* is not at the beginning of the
	string, menus are not drawn properly.
*Space*, *Tab*, *%Space* and *%Tab*:::
	Add gap of one space, or a tab, using the width of the menu font. When
	using a tab, the size of the gap can be one to 8 spaces since the tab
	position is a multiple of 8 from the edge of the menu. The whole
	string must be quoted if spaces or tabs are used.
*%p*:::
	Like Space and Tab *%p* inserts an empty area into the item, but with
	better control of its size (see below).
--
+
You can define an additional space before and after each of the
objects like this
+
....
%left.rightp
....
+
This means: if the object is defined in the menu (e.g. if it is *%s*
and you use a side picture, or it is *%l* for the third column and
there are items defined that actually have a third column), then add
_left_ pixels before the object and _right_ pixels after it. You may
leave out the _left_ or the _.right_ parts if you do not need them.
All values up to the screen width are allowed. Even negative values
can be used with care. The *p* may be replaced with any other
formatting directives described above.
+
Note: Only items defined in the format string are visible in the
menus. So if you do not put a *%s* in there you do not see a side
picture, even if one is specified.
+
Note: The _SubmenusLeft_ style changes the default _ItemFormat_
string, but if it was set manually it is not modified.
+
Note: If any unformatted title of the menu is wider than the widest
menu item, the spaces between the different parts of the menu items
are enlarged to match the width of the title. Leading left aligned
objects in the format string (*%l*, *%i*, *%<*, first *%|*) stick to
the left edge of the menu and trailing right aligned objects (*%r*,
*%i*, *%>*, second *%|*) stick to the right edge. The gaps between the
remaining items are enlarged equally.
+
Examples:
+
....
MenuStyle * ItemFormat "%.4s%.1|%.5i%.5l%.5l%.5r%.5i%2.3>%1|"
....
+
Is the default string used by fvwm: (side picture + 4 pixels gap)
(beginning of the hilighted area + 1 pixel gap) (mini icon + 5p)
(first column left aligned + 5p) (second column left aligned + 5p)
(third column right aligned + 5p) (second mini icon + 5p) (2p + sub
menu triangle + 3p) (1p + end of hilighted area).
+
....
MenuStyle * ItemFormat "%.1|%3.2<%5i%5l%5l%5r%5i%1|%4s"
....
+
Is used by fvwm with the _SubmenusLeft_ option below.
+
_VerticalItemSpacing_ and _VerticalTitleSpacing_ control the vertical
spacing of menu items and titles like _ItemFormat_ controls the
horizontal spacing. Both take two numeric arguments that may range
from -100 to +100. The first is the gap in pixels above a normal menu
item (or a menu title), the second is the gap in pixels below it.
Negative numbers do not make much sense and may screw up the menu
completely. If no arguments are given or the given arguments are
invalid, the built-in defaults are used: one pixel above the item or
title and two below.
+
_VerticalMargins_ can be used to add some padding at the top and
bottom of menus. It takes two numeric arguments that must be positive
integers (or zero). If the number of arguments or its values are
incorrect, fvwm defaults both to 0, which means no padding at all. If
the values are correct, the first one is used for the top margin, and
the second one is used for the bottom margin.
+
_SubmenusLeft_ mirrors the menu layout and behavior. Sub menus pop up
to the left, the sub menu triangle is drawn left and the mini icon and
side picture are drawn at the right side of the menu. The default is
_SubmenusRight_. The position hints of a menu are also affected by
this setting, i.e. position hints using _item_ or _menu_ as context
rectangle and position hints using _m_ offsets.
+
_AutomaticHotkeys_ and _!AutomaticHotkeys_ control the menu's ability
to automatically provide hot-keys on the first character of each menu
item's label. This behavior is always overridden if an explicit
hot-key is assigned in the *AddToMenu* command.
+
_UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate_ and _!UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate_
controls how menu items are invoked when used with hotkeys. By
default, if a given menu entry only has one completeable match for a
given hotkey, the action for that menu entry is invoked and the menu
is closed. This is due to the _UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate_ option.
However, the menu can be told to remain open, waiting for the user to
invoke the selected item instead when there is only one matched item
for a given hotkey, by using the _!UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate_
option.
+
_MouseWheel_ controls the ability to scroll the menu using a mouse
wheel. It takes one argument, that can be one of ScrollsPointer,
ScrollsMenu, ScrollsMenuBackwards or ActivatesItem. ScrollsPointer
makes the mouse wheel scroll the pointer over a menu. This is the
default. ScrollsMenu and ScrollsMenuBackwards scroll the menu beneath
the pointer. ActivatesItem disables scrolling by mouse wheel and makes
the use of a mouse wheel act as if the menu was clicked. If no
argument is supplied the default setting is restored.
+
_ScrollOffPage_ allows a menu to be scrolled out of the visible area
if _MouseWheel_ is set to ScrollsMenu or ScrollsMenuBackwards. This is
the default. The opposite, _!ScrollOffPage_ disables this behaviour.
+
_TrianglesUseFore_ draws sub menu triangles with the foreground color
of the menu colorset (normally drawn with the hilight color).
_!TrianglesUseFore_ disables this behaviour.

=== Miscellaneous Commands

*BugOpts* [_option_ [_bool_]], ...::
	This command controls several workarounds for bugs in third party
	programs. The individual options are separated by commas. The optional
	argument _bool_ is a boolean argument and controls if the bug
	workaround is enabled or not. It can either be "True" or "False" to
	turn the option on or off, or "toggle" to switch is back and forth. If
	_bool_ is omitted, the default setting is restored.
+
_DebugRandR_ activates monitor layout debug messages.
+
_FlickeringMoveWorkaround_ disables ConfigureNotify events that are
usually sent to an application while it is moved. If some windows
flicker annoyingly while being moved, this option may help you. Note
that if this problem occurs it is not an fvwm bug, it is a problem of
the application.
+
_MixedVisualWorkaround_ makes fvwm install the root colormap before it
does some operations using the root window visuals. This is only
useful when the *-visual* option is used to start fvwm and then only
with some configurations of some servers (e.g. Exceed 6.0 with an 8
bit PseudoColor root and fvwm using a 24 bit TrueColor visual).
+
The _ModalityIsEvil_ option controls whether Motif applications have
the ability to have modal dialogs (dialogs that force you to close
them first before you can do anything else). The default is to not
allow applications to have modal dialogs. Use this option with care.
Once this option is turned on, you have to restart fvwm to turn it
off.
+
_RaiseOverNativeWindows_ makes fvwm try to raise the windows it
manages over native windows of the X server's host system. This is
needed for some X servers running under Windows, Windows NT or Mac OS X.
Fvwm tries to detect if it is running under such an X server and
initializes the flag accordingly.
+
_RaiseOverUnmanaged_ makes fvwm try to raise the windows it manages
over override_redirect windows. This is used to cope with ill-mannered
applications that use long-lived windows of this sort, contrary to
ICCCM conventions. It is useful with the _Unmanaged_ style option too.
+
_FlickeringQtDialogsWorkaround_ suppresses flickering of the focused
window in some modules when using KDE or QT applications with
application modal dialog windows. By default this option is turned on.
This option may be visually disturbing for other applications using
windows not managed by fvwm. Since these applications are rare it is
most likely safe to leave this option at its default.
+
_QtDragnDropWorkaround_ suppresses the forwarding of unknown
ClientEvent messages to windows -- usually this is harmless, but Qt
has problems handling unrecognised ClientEvent messages. Enabling this
option might therefore help for Qt applications using DragnDrop. This
option is off by default.
+
_EWMHIconicStateWorkaround_ is needed by EWMH compliant pagers or
taskbars which represent windows which are on a different desktops as
iconified. These pagers and taskbars use a version of the EWMH
specification before version 1.2 (the current KDE 2 & 3 versions).
These pagers and taskbars use the IconicState WM_STATE state to
determine if an application is iconified. This state, according to the
ICCCM, does not imply that a window is iconified (in the usual sense).
Turning on this option forces fvwm to establish an equivalence between
the IconicState WM_STATE state and the iconified window. This violates
ICCCM compliance but should not cause big problems. By default this
option is off.
+
With the _DisplayNewWindowNames_ enabled, fvwm prints the name, icon
name (if available), resource and class of new windows to the console.
This can help in finding the correct strings to use in the *Style*
command.
+
When the _ExplainWindowPlacement_ option is enabled, fvwm prints a
message to the console whenever a new window is placed or
*PlaceAgain*, is used. The message explains on which desk, page,
screen and position it was placed and why. This option can be used to
figure out why a specific window does not appear where you think it
should.
+
The _DebugCRMotionMethod_ option enables some debugging code in the
ConfigureRequest handling routines of fvwm. It is not helpful for the
user, but if you report a bug to the fvwm team we may ask you to
enable this option.
+
The _TransliterateUtf8_ option enables transliteration during
conversions from utf-8 strings. By default fvwm will not transliterate
during conversion, but will fall back to alternate strings provided by
the clients if conversion from utf-8 fails due to characters which
have no direct correspondence in the target charecter set. Some
clients however neglect to set non utf-8 properties correctly in which
case this option may help.

*BusyCursor* [_Option_ _bool_], ...::
	This command controls the cursor during the execution of certain
	commands. _Option_ can be _DynamicMenu_, _ModuleSynchronous_, _Read_,
	_Wait_ or _*_. An option must be followed by a boolean argument
	_bool_. You can use commas to separate individual options. If you set
	an option to "True", then when the corresponding command is run, fvwm
	displays the cursor of the _WAIT_ context of the *CursorStyle*
	command. "False" forces to not display the cursor. The default is:
+

....
BusyCursor DynamicMenu False, ModuleSynchronous False, \
Read False, Wait False
....

+
The _*_ option refers to all available options.
+
The _Read_ option controls the *PipeRead* command.
+
The _DynamicMenu_ option affects the _DynamicPopupAction_ and
_MissingSubmenuFunction_ options of the *AddToMenu* command. If this
option is set to "False", then the busy cursor is not displayed during
a dynamic menu command even if this command is a *Read* or *PipeRead*
command and the _Read_ option is set to "True".
+
The _ModuleSynchronous_ option affects the *ModuleSynchronous*
command. If this option is set to "False", then the busy cursor is not
displayed while fvwm waits for a module started by *ModuleSynchronous*
to complete its startup.
+
The _Wait_ option affects only the root cursor. During a wait pause
the root cursor is replaced by the busy cursor and fvwm is still fully
functional (you can escape from the pause, see the *EscapeFunc*
command). If you want to use this option and if you do not use the
default root cursor, you must set your root cursor with the
*CursorStyle* command.

*ClickTime* [_delay_]::
	Specifies the maximum delay in milliseconds between a button press and
	a button release for the *Function* command to consider the action a
	mouse click. The default delay is 150 milliseconds. Omitting the delay
	value resets the *ClickTime* to the default.
+
ClickTime also specifies the delay between two clicks to be interpreted as a
double-click.

*ColorLimit* _limit_::
	This command is obsolete. See the *--color-limit* option to fvwm.

*ColormapFocus* FollowsMouse | FollowsFocus::
	By default, fvwm installs the colormap of the window that the cursor
	is in. If you use
+

....
ColormapFocus FollowsFocus
....

+
then the installed colormap is the one for the window that currently
has the keyboard focus.

*CursorStyle* _context_ [_num_ | _name_ | None | Tiny | _file_ [_x_ _y_] [_fg_ _bg_]]::
	Defines a new cursor for the specified context. Note that this command
	can not control the shapes an applications uses, for example, to
	indicate that it is busy. The various contexts are:
+
_POSITION_ (top_left_corner):::
	used when initially placing windows
+
_TITLE_ (top_left_arrow):::
	used in a window title-bar
+
_DEFAULT_ (top_left_arrow):::
	used in windows that do not set their cursor
+
_SYS_ (hand2):::
	used in one of the title-bar buttons
+
_MOVE_ (fleur):::
	used when moving or resizing windows
+
_RESIZE_ (sizing):::
	used when moving or resizing windows
+
_WAIT_ (watch):::
	used during certain fvwm commands (see *BusyCursor* for details)
+
_MENU_ (top_left_arrow):::
	used in menus
+
_SELECT_ (crosshair):::
	used when the user is required to select a window
+
_DESTROY_ (pirate):::
	used for *Destroy*, *Close*, and *Delete* commands
+
_TOP_ (top_side):::
	used in the top side-bar of a window
+
_RIGHT_ (right_side):::
	used in the right side-bar of a window
+
_BOTTOM_ (bottom_side):::
	used in the bottom side-bar of a window
+
_LEFT_ (left_side):::
	used in the left side-bar of a window
+
_TOP_LEFT_ (top_left_corner):::
	used in the top left corner of a window
+
_TOP_RIGHT_ (top_right_corner):::
	used in the top right corner of a window
+
_BOTTOM_LEFT_ (bottom_left_corner):::
	used in the bottom left corner of a window
+
_BOTTOM_RIGHT_ (bottom_right_corner):::
	used in the bottom right corner of a window
+
_TOP_EDGE_ (top_side):::
	used at the top edge of the screen
+
_RIGHT_EDGE_ (right_side):::
	used at the right edge of the screen
+
_BOTTOM_EDGE_ (bottom_side):::
	used at the bottom edge of the screen
+
_LEFT_EDGE_ (left_side):::
	used at the left edge of the screen
+
_ROOT_ (left_ptr):::
	used as the root cursor

The defaults are shown in parentheses above. If you ever want to
restore the default cursor for a specific context you can omit the
second argument.

The second argument is either the numeric value of the cursor as
defined in the include file _X11/cursorfont.h_ or its name (without
the XC_ prefix). Alternatively, the xpm file name may be specified.
The name can also be _None_ (no cursor) or _Tiny_ (a single pixel as
the cursor).

....
# make the kill cursor be XC_gumby (both forms work):
CursorStyle DESTROY 56
CursorStyle DESTROY gumby
....


Alternatively, the cursor can be loaded from an (XPM, PNG or SVG)
image _file_. If fvwm is compiled with Xcursor support, full ARGB is
used, and (possibly animated) cursor files made with the *xcursorgen*
program can be loaded. Otherwise the cursor is converted to
monochrome.

The optional _x_ and _y_ arguments (following a _file_ argument)
specifies the hot-spot coordinate with 0 0 as the top left corner of
the image. Coordinates within the image boundary are valid and
overrides any hot-spot defined in the (XPM/Xcursor) image file. An
invalid or undefined hot-spot is placed in the center of the image.

....
CursorStyle ROOT cursor_image.png 0 0
....

The optional _fg_ and _bg_ arguments specify the foreground and
background colors for the cursor, defaulting to black and white
(reverse video compared to the actual bitmap). These colors are only
used with monochrome cursors. Otherwise they are silently ignored.

....
CursorStyle ROOT nice_arrow.xpm yellow black
....

*DefaultFont* [_fontname_]::
	*DefaultFont* sets the default font to font _fontname_. The default
	font is used by fvwm whenever no other font has been specified. To
	reset the default font to the built-in default, omit the argument. The
	default font is used for menus, window titles, icon titles as well as
	the geometry feedback windows during a move or resize operation. To
	override the default font in a specific context, use the *Style* *
	_Font_, *Style* * _IconFont_, or *MenuStyle* commands.

*DefaultIcon* _filename_::
	Sets the default icon which is used if a window has neither an
	client-supplied icon nor an icon supplied via the _Icon_ option of the
	*Style* command.

*DefaultLayers* _bottom_ _put_ _top_::
	Changes the layers that are used for the _StaysOnBottom_, _StaysPut_,
	_StaysOnTop_ *Style* options. Initially, the layers 2, 4 and 6 are
	used.

*Deschedule* [_command_id_]::
	Removes all commands that were scheduled with the id _command_id_ with
	the *Schedule* command from the list of commands to be executed unless
	they were already executed. If the _command_id_ is omitted, the value
	of the variable $[schedule.last] is used as the id.

*Emulate* Fvwm | Mwm | Win::
	This command is a catch all for how miscellaneous things are done by
	fvwm. Right now this command affects where the move/resize feedback
	window appears and how window placement is aborted. To have more Mwm-
	or Win-like behavior you can call *Emulate* with _Mwm_ or _Win_ as its
	argument. With Mwm resize and move feedback windows are in the center
	of the screen, instead of the upper left corner. This also affects how
	manual placement is aborted. See the _ManualPlacement_ description.

*EscapeFunc*::
	By default the key sequence Ctrl-Alt-Escape allows for escaping from a
	*Wait* pause and from a locked *ModuleSynchronous* command. The
	*EscapeFunc* command used with the *Key* command allows for
	configuring this key sequence. An example:
+

....
Key Escape A MC -
Key Escape A  S EscapeFunc
....

+

replaces the Ctrl-Alt-Escape  key sequence with Shift-Escape for aborting a
*Wait* pause and *ModuleSynchronous* command.  *EscapeFunc* used outside the
*Key* command does nothing.

*FakeClick* [_command_ _value_] ...::
	This command is mainly intended for debugging fvwm and no guarantees
	are made that it works for you. _FakeClick_ can simulate mouse button
	press and release events and pass them to fvwm or the applications.
	The parameters are a list of commands which consist of pairs of
	_command_ tokens and integer _values_, The _press_ and _release_
	commands are followed by the appropriate mouse button number and
	generate a button press or release event on the window below the
	pointer. The _wait_ commands pauses fvwm for the given number of
	milliseconds. The _modifiers_ command simulates pressing or releasing
	modifier keys. The values 1 to 5 are mapped to Mod1 to Mod5 while 6, 7
	and 8 are mapped to Shift, Lock and Control. The modifier is set for
	any further button events. To release a modifier key, use the
	corresponding negative number. The _depth_ command determines to which
	window the button events are sent. With a depth of 1, all events go to
	the root window, regardless of the pointer's position. With 2, the
	event is passed to the top level window under the pointer which is
	usually the frame window. With 3, events go to the client window.
	Higher numbers go to successive sub windows. Zero (0) goes to the
	smallest window that contains the pointer. Note that events propagate
	upward.
+

....
FakeClick depth 2 press 1 wait 250 release 1
....

+
This simulates a click with button 1 in the parent window (depth 2)
with a delay of 250 milliseconds between the press and the release.
Note: all command names can be abbreviated with their first letter.

*FakeKeypress* [_command_ _value_] ...::
	This command is mainly intended for debugging fvwm and no guarantees
	are made that it works for you. *FakeKeypress* can simulate key press
	and release events and pass them to fvwm or applications. The
	parameters are a list of commands which consist of pairs of command
	tokens and values. The _press_ and _release_ commands are followed by
	a key name. The key name is a standard X11 key name as defined in
	_/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h_, (without the _XK__ prefix), or the
	keysym database _/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB_. The _wait_,
	_modifiers_ and _depth_ commands are the same as those used by
	*FakeClick*.
+
Save all GVim sessions with: "Esc:w\n"
+

....
All (gvim) FakeKeypress press Escape \
                  press colon \
                  press w \
                  press Return
....

+
Save & exit all GVim sessions with: "Esc:wq\n"
+

....
All (gvim) FakeKeypress press Escape \
                  press colon \
                  press w \
                  press q \
                  press Return
....

+
Send A to a specific window:
+

....
WindowId 0x3800002 FakeKeypress press A
....

+
Note: all command names can be abbreviated with their first letter.

*HilightColorset* [_num_]::
	This command is obsoleted by the *Style* option _HilightColorset_.
	Please use
+

....
Style * HilightColorset num
....

+
instead.

*IconFont* [_fontname_]::
	This command is obsoleted by the *Style* option _IconFont_. Please use
+

....
Style * IconFont fontname
....

+
instead.

*IconPath* _path_::
	This command is obsolete. Please use *ImagePath* instead.

*ImagePath* _path_::
	Specifies a colon separated list of directories in which to search for
	images (both monochrome and pixmap). To find an image given by a
	relative pathname, fvwm looks into each directory listed in turn, and
	uses the first file found.
+
If a directory is given in the form "/some/dir;.ext", this means all
images in this directory have the extension ".ext" that should be
forced. The original image name (that may contain another extension or
no extension at all) is not probed, instead ".ext" is added or
replaces the original extension. This is useful, for example, if a
user has some image directories with ".xpm" images and other image
directories with the same names, but ".png" images.
+
The _path_ may contain environment variables such as _$HOME_ (or
_$\{HOME}_). Further, a '+' in the _path_ is expanded to the previous
value of the path, allowing appending or prepending to the path
easily.
+
For example:
+

....
ImagePath $HOME/icons:+:/usr/include/X11/bitmaps
....

*LocalePath* _path_::
	Specifies a colon separated list of "locale path" in which to search
	for string translations. A locale path is constituted by a directory
	path and a text domain separated by a semicolon (';'). As an example
	the default locale path is:
+

....
/install_prefix/share/locale;fvwm
....

+
where install_prefix is the fvwm installation directory. With such a
locale path translations are searched for in
+

....
/install_prefix/share/locale/lang/LC_MESSAGES/fvwm.mo
....

+
where _lang_ depends on the locale. If no directory is given the
default directory path is assumed. If no text domain is given, *fvwm*
is assumed. Without argument the default locale path is restored.
+
As for the *ImagePath* command, _path_ may contain environment
variables and a '+' to append or prepend the locale path easily.
+
For example, the fvwm-themes package uses
+

....
LocalePath ";fvwm-themes:+"
....

+
to add locale catalogs.
+
The default fvwm catalog contains a few strings used by the fvwm
executable itself (Desk and Geometry) and strings used in some default
configuration files and *FvwmForm* configuration. You can take a look
at the po/ subdirectory of the fvwm source to get the list of the
strings with a possible translation in various languages. At present,
very few languages are supported.
+
The main use of locale catalogs is via the "$[gt.string]" parameter:
+

....
DestroyMenu MenuFvwmWindowOps
AddToMenu   MenuFvwmWindowOps "$[gt.Window Ops]" Title
+ "$[gt.&Move]"              Move
+ "$[gt.&Resize]"            Resize
+ "$[gt.R&aise]"             Raise
+ "$[gt.&Lower]"             Lower
+ "$[gt.(De)&Iconify]"       Iconify
+ "$[gt.(Un)&Stick]"         Stick
+ "$[gt.(Un)Ma&ximize]"      Maximize
+ "" Nop
+ "$[gt.&Close]"             Close
+ "$[gt.&Destroy]"           Destroy
....

+
gives a menu in the locale languages if translations are available.
+
Note that the *FvwmScript* module has a set of special instructions
for string translation. It is out of the scope of this discussion to
explain how to build locale catalogs. Please refer to the GNU gettext
documentation.

*PixmapPath* _path_::
	This command is obsolete. Please use *ImagePath* instead.

*PrintInfo* _subject_ [_verbose_]::
	Print information on _subject_ to debug log file, which defaults to
	_$HOME/.fvwm/fvwm3-output.log_ . Environment variables _$FVWM_USERDIR_
	and _$FVWM3_LOGFILE_ can alter this default. For this logfile to be
	written, either fvwm3 has to be started with *-v* option or *SIGUSR2*
	signal can be used to toggle opening/closing debug log file.
+
An optional integer argument to debug log file, which defaults to
_$HOME/.fvwm/fvwm3-output.log_ . Environment variables _$FVWM_USERDIR_
and _$FVWM3_LOGFILE_ can alter this default. For this logfile to be
written, either fvwm3 has to be started with *-v* option or *SIGUSR2*
signal can be used to toggle opening/closing debug log file.
+
An optional integer argument _verbose_ defines the level of
information which is given. The current valid subjects are:
+
_Colors_ which prints information about the colors used by fvwm. This
useful on screens which can only display 256 (or less) colors at once.
If _verbose_ is one or greater the palette used by fvwm is printed. If
you have a limited color palette, and you run out of colors, this
command might be helpful.
+
_ImageCache_ which prints information about the images loaded by fvwm.
If _verbose_ is one or greater all images in the cache will be listed
together with their respective reuse.
+
_Locale_ which prints information on your locale and the fonts that
fvwm used. _verbose_ can be 1 or 2.
+
_nls_ which prints information on the locale catalogs that fvwm used
+
_style_ which prints information on fvwm styles. _verbose_ can be 1.
+
_bindings_ which prints information on all the bindings fvwm has: key
and mouse bindings. _verbose_ has no effect with this option.
+
_infostore_ which prints information on all entries in the infostore,
listing the key and its value. _verbose_ has no effect with this
option.

*Schedule* [_Periodic_] _delay_ms_ [_command_id_] _command_::
	The _command_ is executed after about _delay_ms_ milliseconds. This
	may be useful in some tricky setups. The _command_ is executed in the
	same context window as the *Schedule* command. An optional integer
	argument _command_id_ may be given in decimal, hexadecimal or octal
	format. This id can be used with the *Deschedule* command to remove
	the scheduled command before it is executed. If no id is given, fvwm
	uses negative id numbers, starting with -1 and decreasing by one with
	each use of the *Schedule* command. Note that the *Schedule* command
	and its arguments undergo the usual command line expansion, and, when
	_command_ is finally executed, it is expanded again. It may therefore
	be necessary to quote the parts of the command that must not be
	expanded twice.
+
Note: A window's id as it is returned with $[w.id] can be used as the
_command_id_. Example:
+

....
Current Schedule 1000 $[w.id] WindowShade
....

+
The *Schedule* command also supports the optional keyword _Periodic_
which indicates that the _command_ should be executed every
_delay_ms_. Example:
+

....
Schedule Periodic 10000 PipeRead '[ -N "$MAIL" ] && echo \
 Echo You have mail'
....

+
Use the *Deschedule* command to stop periodic commands.

*State* _state_ [_bool_]::
	Sets, clears or toggles one of the 32 user defined states which are associated
	with each window. The _state_ is a number ranging from 0 to 31. The states
	have no meaning in fvwm, but they can be checked in conditional commands like
	*Next* with the _State_ condition. The optional argument _bool_ is a boolean
	argument. "True" sets the given state, while "False" clears it. Using "toggle"
	switches to the opposite state. If the _bool_ argument is not given, the state
	is toggled.

*WindowFont* [_fontname_]::
	This command is obsoleted by the *Style* option _Font_. Please use
+
....
Style * Font fontname
....
+
instead.

*WindowList* [(_conditions_)] [_position_] [_options_] [_double-click-action_]::
	Generates a pop-up menu (and pops it up) in which the title and
	geometry of each of the windows currently on the desktop are shown.
+
The format of the geometry part is: _desk_(_layer_): _x-geometry_
_sticky_, where _desk_ and _layer_ are the corresponding numbers and
_sticky_ is empty or a capital S. The geometry of iconified windows is
shown in parentheses. Selecting an item from the window list pop-up
menu causes the interpreted function "WindowListFunc" to be run with
the window id of that window passed in as $0. The default
"WindowListFunc" looks like this:
+

....
AddToFunc WindowListFunc
+ I Iconify off
+ I FlipFocus
+ I Raise
+ I WarpToWindow 5p 5p
....

+
You can destroy the built-in "WindowListFunc" and create your own if
these defaults do not suit you.
+
The window list menu uses the "WindowList" menu style if it is defined
(see *MenuStyle* command). Otherwise the default menu style is used.
To switch back to the default menu style, issue the command
+

....
DestroyMenuStyle WindowList
....

+
Example:

....
MenuStyle WindowList SelectOnRelease Meta_L
....

+
The _conditions_ can be used to exclude certain windows from the
window list. Please refer to the *Current* command for details. Only
windows that match the given conditions are displayed in the window
list. The _options_ below work vice versa: windows that would
otherwise not be included in the window list can be selected with
them. The _conditions_ always override the _options_.
+
The _position_ arguments are the same as for *Menu*. The command
_double-click-action_ is invoked if the user double-clicks (or hits
the key rapidly twice if the menu is bound to a key) when bringing the
window list. The _double-click-action_ must be quoted if it consists
of more than one word.
+
The _double-click-action_ is useful to define a default window if you
have bound the window list to a key (or button) like this:
+

....
# Here we call an existing function, but
# it may be different.  See the default
# WindowListFunc definition earlier in this
# man page.
AddToFunc SwitchToWindow
+ I WindowListFunc

Key Tab A M WindowList "Prev SwitchToWindow"
....

+
Hitting Alt-Tab once it brings up the window list, if you hit it twice the
focus is flipped between the current and the last focused window. With the
proper _SelectOnRelease_ menu style (see example above) a window is selected
as soon as you release the Alt key.
+
The _options_ passed to WindowList are separated by commas and can be
_Geometry_ / _NoGeometry_ / _NoGeometryWithInfo_, _NoDeskNum,_
_NoLayer,_ _NoNumInDeskTitle_, _NoCurrentDeskTitle_, _MaxLabelWidth
width_, _TitleForAllDesks_, _Function funcname_, _Desk desknum_,
_CurrentDesk_, _NoIcons_ / _Icons_ / _OnlyIcons_, _NoNormal_ /
_Normal_ / _OnlyNormal_, _NoSticky_ / _Sticky_ / _OnlySticky_,
_NoStickyAcrossPages_ / _StickyAcrossPages_ / _OnlyStickyAcrossPages_,
_NoStickyAcrossDesks_ / _StickyAcrossDesks_ / _OnlyStickyAcrossDesks_,
_NoOnTop_ / _OnTop_ / _OnlyOnTop_, _NoOnBottom_ / _OnBottom_ /
_OnlyOnBottom_, _Layer m [n]_, _UseSkipList_ / _OnlySkipList_,
_NoDeskSort_, _ReverseOrder_, _CurrentAtEnd_, _IconifiedAtEnd_,
_UseIconName_, _Alphabetic_ / _NotAlphabetic_, _SortByResource_,
_SortByClass_, _NoHotkeys_, _SelectOnRelease_.
+
(Note - normal means not iconic, sticky, or on top)
+
With the _SortByResource_ option windows are alphabetically sorted
first by resource class, then by resource name and then by window name
(or icon name if _UseIconName_ is specified). _ReverseOrder_ also
works in the expected manner.
+
With the _SortByClass_ option windows are sorted just like with
_SortByResource_, but the resource name is not taken into account,
only the resource class.
+
The _SelectOnRelease_ option works exactly like the *MenuStyle* option
with the same name, but overrides the option given in a menu style. By
default, this option is set to the left
+
key. To switch it off, use _SelectOnRelease_ without a key name.
+
If you pass in a function via *Function* funcname, it is called within
a window context of the selected window:
+

....
AddToFunc IFunc I Iconify toggle
WindowList Function IFunc, NoSticky, CurrentDesk, NoIcons
....

+
If you use the _Layer_ _m_ [_n_] option, only windows in layers
between m and n are displayed. n defaults to m. With the
_ReverseOrder_ option the order of the windows in the list is
reversed.
+
With the _CurrentAtEnd_ option the currently focused window (if any)
is shown at the bottom of the list. This is mostly intended for
simulating the Alt-Tab behavior in another GUI.
+
_IconifiedAtEnd_ makes iconified windows be moved to the end of the
list. This is also from another GUI.
+
The _NoGeometry_ option causes fvwm to not display the geometries as
well as the separators which indicate the different desktops.
_NoGeometryWithInfo_ removes the geometries, but keep the desktop
information and indicates iconic windows. _NoDeskNum_ causes fvwm to
not display the desktop number in the geometry or before the window
title with the _NoGeometryWithInfo_ option. _NoNumInDeskTitle_ is only
useful if a desktop name is defined with the *DesktopName* command. It
causes fvwm to not display the desktop number before the desktop name.
By default, the WindowList menu have a title which indicates the
current desk or the selected desktop if the _Desk_ condition is used.
The _NoCurrentDeskTitle_ option removes this title. _TitleForAllDesks_
causes fvwm to add a menu title with the desk name and/or number
before each group of windows on the same desk. With _NoLayer_, the
layer of the window is not displayed. The options _ShowPage_,
_ShowPageX_ and _ShowPageY_ enable displaying the page of the window
rounded multiples of the display size. With _ShowScreen_, the window's
screen name is displayed.
+
The _MaxLabelWidth_ option takes the number of characters to print as
its argument. No more than that many characters of the window name are
visible.
+
If you wanted to use the *WindowList* as an icon manager, you could
invoke the following:
+

....
WindowList OnlyIcons, Sticky, OnTop, Geometry
....

+
(Note - the _Only_ options essentially wipe out all other ones... but
the _OnlyListSkip_ option which just causes *WindowList* to only
consider the windows with _WindowListSkip_ style.)

*XSync*::
	When *XSync* is called, the X function with the same name is used to
	send all pending X requests to the server. This command is intended
	for debugging only.

*XSynchronize* [bool]::
	The *XSynchronize* command controls whether X requests are sent to the
	X server immediately or not. Normally, requests are sent in larger
	batches to save unnecessary communication. To send requests
	immediately, use "True" as the argument, to disable this use "False"
	or to toggle between both methods use "Toggle" or omit the *bool*
	argument. Fvwm defaults to synchronized requests when started with the
	*--debug* option. This command is intended for debugging only.

*+*::
	Used to continue adding to the last specified decor, function or menu.
	See the discussion for *AddToDecor*, *AddToFunc*, and *AddToMenu*.

=== Window Movement and Placement

*AnimatedMove* _x_ _y_ [Warp]::
	Move a window in an animated fashion. Similar to *Move* command. The
	options are the same, except they are required, since it doesn't make
	sense to have a user move the window interactively and animatedly. If
	the optional argument _Warp_ is specified the pointer is warped with
	the window.

*GeometryWindow* Hide | Show | Colorset _n_ | Position _x_ _y_ | Screen _S_::
	Configures the position or size window that is usually shown when a
	window is moved or resized interactively. This can be used to hide,
	show, change the colorset, change the location, or change the screen
	of the geometry window. Multiple options can be set at once separated
	by spaces. Details of each option are described below.
+
....
GeometryWindow Hide [Never | Move | Resize]
....
+
Hides or switches off the geometry window. If the optional parameters _Move_
or _Resize_ are given, it will only hide the geometry window during the
respective operation. The parameter _Never_ will switch the geometry back on
again (equivalent to _Show_).
+
....
GeometryWindow Show [Never | Move | Resize]
....
+
Shows or switches on the geometry window (equivalent to _Hide Never_). If
the optional parameters _Move_ or _Resize_ are given, it will only show the
geometry window during the respective operation. The parameter _Never_ will
switch the geometry window off (equivalent to _Hide_).
+
....
GeometryWindow Colorset _cset_
....
+
Sets colorset of the gometry window to _cset_. Use the literal option
_default_ for _cset_ to use the default colorset.
+
....
GeometryWindow Position [+|-]_x_[p] [+|-]_y_[p]
....
+
Configures the position the geometry window appears. _x_ and _y_ are the
relative coordinates as a percentage of the screen size. If a leading '-'
is provided the coordinates are computed from the left/bottom of the screen
respectively. If the coordinates are appended with a 'p', they are interpreted
as the number of pixels from the respective screen edge. If no position
arguments are given, the geometry window's position will return to its default
state of the upper left corner or the center if emulating MWM.
+
....
GeometryWindow Screen _RANDRNAME_
....
+
Configure which screen the geometry window is shown on. By default the
geometry window is shown on the current screen. If a valid _RANDRNAME_
is provided, the geometry window will always be shown on that screen.
Use _current_ as the _RANDRNAME_ to return the default.
+
Examples:
+

....
# Position the geometry window in the center of the screen
GeometryWindow Position 50 50
# Position the geometry window next to the RightPanel
GeometryWindow Position -120p 0
# Use colorset 2 for the geometry window
GeometryWindow Colorset 2
# Only show the geometry window on the primary monitor
GeometryWindow Screen $[monitor.primary]
# Hide the geometry window
GeometryWindow Hide
....


*HideGeometryWindow* [Never | Move | Resize]::
	This command has been depreciated and is now obsolete. Use
        *GeometryWindow Hide* instead.

*Layer* [_arg1_ _arg2_] | [default]::
	Puts the current window in a new layer. If _arg1_ is non zero then the
	next layer is the current layer number plus _arg1_. If _arg1_ is zero
	then the new layer is _arg2_.
+
As a special case, _default_ puts the window in its default layer,
i.e. the layer it was initially in. The same happens if no or invalid
arguments are specified.

*Lower*::
	Allows the user to lower a window. Note that this lowers a window only
	in its layer. To bring a window to the absolute bottom, use
+

....
AddToFunc lower-to-bottom
 + I Layer 0 0
 + I Lower
....

*Move* [_options_]::
	Allows the user to move a window. If called from somewhere in a
	window or its border, then that window is moved. If called from
	the root window, then the user is allowed to select the target
	window.	Move can be called with various options to either start
	an interactive move, specify the position to move, or a direction.
+
*Move* without options starts an interactive move.  The window may snap to
other windows and screen boundaries, configurable with the *SnapAttraction*
style.  Moving a window to the edge of the screen can be used to drag the
window to other pages.  (See *EdgeScroll*, and the _EdgeMoveDelay_ style for
more information.)
+
Holding down _Alt_ disables snapping and allows one to switch pages
without any delay.  Interactive movement can be aborted with the
_Escape_ key or any mouse button not set to place the window. By default mouse
button 2 is set to cancel the move operation. To change this you may
use the *Mouse* command with special context 'P' for Placement.
+
The window condition _PlacedByButton_ can be used to check if a
specific button was pressed to place the window (see *Current*
command).
+
If the single argument _pointer_ is given, the top left corner of the
window is moved to the pointer position before starting an interactive
move; this is mainly intended for internal use by modules like *FvwmPager*.
+
....
Move pointer
....
+
To move a window in a given direction until it hits another window, icon,
or screen boundary use:
+
....
Move shuffle [Warp] [ewmhiwa] [snap _type_] [layers _min_ _max_] _direction_(s)
....
+
The _direction_ can be _North_/_N_/_Up_/_U_, _East_/_E_/_Right_/_R_,
_South_/_S_/_Down_/_D_, or _West_/_W_/_Left_/_L_. The window will move
in the given direction until it hits another window or the
*EwmhBaseStruts*/screen boundary. When a window is at the
*EwmhBaseStruts*/screen boundary, it will move to the next monitor
in the given direction, if it exists. If a window is outside of the
current working area (partly off screen), it will move to the edge of
the working area. Windows will honor the EWMH working area and stop at
the *EwmhBaseStruts* unless the literal option _ewmhiwa_ is given. If
multiple _direction_(s) are given, the window will move the directions
in the order of the sequence stated.
+
The literal option _Warp_ will warp the mouse pointer to the window.
If the literal option _snap_ followed by a snap _type_ of _windows_,
_icons_, or _same_ is given, then the window will only stop if it hits
another window, icon, or the same type. If the literal option _layers_
followed by a _min_ layer and _max_ layer is given, then only windows on
the layers between _min_ and _max_ layers will stop the window. For example:
+

....
# Shuffle the window Right.
Move shuffle Right
# Shuffle Up, only consider windows on Layer 3.
Move shuffle layers 3 3 Up
# Shuffle Left then Up
Move shuffle Left Up
# Shuffle Up then Left (may not be same position as above)
Move shuffle Up Left
....

+
Move can be used to moved a window to a specified position:
+
....
Move [screen _S_] [desk _N_] [w | m | v]_x_[p | w] [w | m | v]_y_[p | w] [Warp] [ewmhiwa]
....
+
This will move the window to the _x_ and _y_ position (see below).
By default, the EWMH working area of each monitor is honoured (the
working area for each monitor is set via *EwmhBaseStruts* and honors
any strut hints provided by windows on the monitor). This means that
if a window is placed outside the working area, the position of the
window will be adjusted to fit inside the working area of the screen
the center of the window is on. If the trailing option _ewmhiwa_ is
given, then the window position will ignore the working area and its
position will not be adjusted (this option is needed to move windows
off the screen and to have full control of where it is placed). If
the option _Warp_ is given then the pointer is warped to the window.
+
If the literal option _screen_ followed by a RandR screen name _S_ is
specified, the coordinates are interpreted as relative to the given
screen. The width and height of the screen are used for the
calculations instead of the display dimensions. The _screen_ is
interpreted as in the *MoveToScreen* command.
+
If the literal option _desk_ followed by a desk number _N_ is specified,
place the window on the specified desk after it has been moved. This can
serve two purposes, first you can move a window's position and desk in a
single command. Second when a window is moved between monitors, its desk
is updated to be the same as the new monitor. This option can override
that behavior by specifying which desk the window should end up on.
+
The positional arguments _x_ and _y_ can specify an absolute or relative
position from either the left/top (positive values) or right/bottom
(negative values) of the global screen (the bounding box that contains all
monitors) or specified _screen_. By default, the numeric value given is
interpreted as a percentage of the screen's width/height, but a trailing
'_p_' changes the interpretation to mean pixels, while a trailing '_w_'
means percent of the window width/height. To move the window relative to
its current position, add the '_w_' (for "window") prefix before the _x_
and/or _y_ value. To move the window to a position relative to the current
location of the pointer, add the '_m_' (for "mouse") prefix. To move the
window relative to the virtual screen coordinates, add the '_v_' (for
"virtual screen") prefix. This is mostly for internal use with FvwmPager,
but can be used to give exact coordinates on the virtual screen and is best
used with the '_p_' suffix. To leave either coordinate unchanged, "_keep_"
can be specified in place of _x_ or _y_.
+
For advanced uses, the arguments _x_ and _y_ can be used multiple
times, but without the prefix '_m_' or '_w_'. (See complex examples
below).
+
Simple Examples:
+

....
# Interactive move
Mouse 1 T A Move
# Move window to top left is at (10%,10%)
Mouse 2 T A Move 10 10
# Move top left to (10pixels,10pixels)
Mouse 3 T A Move 10p 10p
....

+
More complex examples (these can be bound as actions to keystrokes,
etc.; only the command is shown, though):
+

....
# Move window so bottom right is at bottom
# right of screen
Move -0 -0

# Move window so top left corner is 10 pixels
# off the top left screen edge
Move +-10 +-10

# Move window 5% to the right, and to the
# middle vertically
Move w+5 50

# Move window up 10 pixels, and so left edge
# is at x=40 pixels
Move 40p w-10p

# Move window to the mouse pointer location
Move m+0 m+0

# Move window to center of screen (50% of screen
# position minus 50% of widow size).
Move 50-50w 50-50w
....

+
See also the *AnimatedMove* command.
+

*MoveToDesk* [prev | _arg1_ [_arg2_] [_min_ _max_]]::
	Moves the selected window to another desktop. The arguments are the
	same as for the *GotoDesk* command. Without any arguments, the window
	is moved to the current desk. *MoveToDesk* is a replacement for the
	obsolete *WindowsDesk* command, which can no longer be used.

*MoveThreshold* [_pixels_]::
	When the user presses a mouse button upon an object fvwm waits to see
	if the action is a click or a drag. If the mouse moves by more than
	_pixels_ pixels it is assumed to be a drag.
+
Previous versions of fvwm hardwired _pixels_ to 3, which is now the
default value. If _pixels_ is negative or omitted the default value
(which might be increased when 16000x9000 pixel displays become
affordable) is restored.

*MoveToPage* [_options_] [_x_[p | w] _y_[p | w]] | [prev]::
	Moves the selected window to another page (_x_,_y_). The upper left
	page is (0,0), the upper right is (M,0), where M is one less than the
	current number of horizontal pages specified in the *DesktopSize*
	command. Similarly the lower left page is (0,N), and the lower right
	page is (M,N). Negative page numbers refer to pages from the
	rightmost/lowest page. If _x_ and _y_ are not given, the window is
	moved to the current page (a window that has the focus but is
	off-screen can be retrieved with this). Moving windows to a page
	relative to the current page can be achieved by adding a trailing
	'_p_' after any or both numerical arguments. To move the window
	relative to its current location, add a trailing '_w_'. To move a
	window to the previous page use _prev_ as the single argument.
+
Windows are usually not moved beyond desk boundaries.
+
Possible _options_ are _wrapx_ and _wrapy_ to wrap around the x or y
coordinate when the window is moved beyond the border of the desktop.
For example, with _wrapx_, when the window moves past the right edge
of the desktop, it reappears on the left edge. The options
_nodesklimitx_ and _nodesklimity_ allow moving windows beyond the desk
boundaries in x and y direction (disabling the _wrapx_ and _wrapy_
options).
+
Examples:
+

....
# Move window to page (2,3)
MoveToPage 2 3

# Move window to lowest and rightmost page
MoveToPage -1 -1

# Move window to last page visited
MoveToPage prev

# Move window two pages to the right and one
# page up, wrap at desk boundaries
MoveToPage wrapx wrapy +2p -1p
....

*MoveToScreen* [_screen_]::
	Moves the selected window to another screen. The _screen_ argument
	must be a valid RandR name.

*OpaqueMoveSize* [_percentage_]::
	Tells fvwm the maximum size window with which opaque window movement
	should be used. The percentage is percent of the total screen area
	(may be greater than 100). With
+

....
OpaqueMoveSize 0
....

+
all windows are moved using the traditional rubber-band outline. With
+

....
OpaqueMoveSize unlimited
....

+
or if a negative percentage is given all windows are moved as solid
windows. The default is
+

....
OpaqueMoveSize 5
....

+
which allows small windows to be moved in an opaque manner but large
windows are moved as rubber-bands. If _percentage_ is omitted or
invalid the default value is set. To resize windows in an opaque
manner you can use the _ResizeOpaque_ style. See the *Style* command.

*PlaceAgain* [Anim] [Icon]::
	Causes the current window's position to be re-computed using the
	initial window placement logic. The window is moved to where it would
	have been if it were a new window that had just appeared. Most useful
	with _Smart_ or _Clever_ (_ReallySmart_) placement. With the optional
	argument _Anim_ an animated move is used to place the window in its
	new position. With the additional option _Icon_, the icon is placed
	again instead.

*Raise*::
	Allows the user to raise a window. Note that this raises a window only
	in its layer. To bring a window to the absolute top, use
+

....
AddToFunc raise-to-top
 + I Layer 0 ontop
 + I Raise
....

+
where ontop is the highest layer used in your setup.

*RaiseLower*::
	Alternately raises and lowers a window. The window is raised if it is
	obscured by any window (except for its own transients when
	_RaiseTransient_ style is used; see the *Style* command) otherwise it
	is lowered.

*Resize* [[frame] [direction _dir_] [warptoborder _automatic_] [fixeddirection] [w]_width_[p | c | wa | da] [w]_height_[p | c]]::
	Allows for resizing a window. If called from somewhere in a window or
	its border, then that window is resized. If called from the root
	window then the user is allowed to select the target window.
+
*Resize* without options starts an interactive resize.
+
If the _EdgeResizeDelay_ style is set or the _Alt_ key is held down,
the window can be resized across the edge of the screen.
+
The operation can be aborted with the _Escape_ key or by pressing
any mouse button (except button 1 which confirms it).
+
If the optional arguments _width_ and _height_ are provided, then the
window is resized so that its dimensions are _width_ by _height_. The
units of _width_ and _height_ are percent-of-screen, unless a letter
'_p_' is appended to one or both coordinates, in which case the
location is specified in pixels. With a '_c_' suffix the unit defined
by the client application (hence the c) is used. With the suffix
'_wa_' the value is a percentage of the width or height size of the
EWMH working area, and with the suffix '_da_' it is a percentage of
the width or height of the EWMH dynamic working area. So you can say
+

....
Resize 80c 24c
....

+
to make a terminal window just big enough for 80x24 characters.
+
If the _width_ or _height_ is prefixed with the letter '_w_' the size
is not taken as an absolute value but added to the current size of the
window. Example:
+

....
# Enlarge window by one line
Resize keep w+1c
....

+
Both, _width_ and _height_ can be negative. In this case the new size
is the screen size minus the given value. If either value is "_keep_",
the corresponding dimension of the window is left untouched. The new
size is the size of the client window, thus
+

....
Resize 100 100
....

+
may make the window bigger than the screen. To base the new size on
the size of the whole fvwm window, add the _frame_ option after the
command. The options _fixeddirection_, _direction_ and _warptoborder_
are only used in interactive move operations. With _fixeddirection_
the same border is moved even if the pointer moves past the opposite
border. The _direction_ option must be followed by a direction name
such as "NorthWest", "South" or "East" (you get the idea). Resizing is
started immediately, even if the pointer is not on a border. If the
special option _automatic_ is given as a direction argument, then the
direction to resize is calculated based on the position of the pointer
in the window. If the pointer is in the middle of the window, then no
direction is calculated. The _warptoborder_ option can be used to warp
the pointer to the direction indicated. As with the _automatic_ option
for _direction_, the border to warp to is calculated based on the
pointer's proximity to a given border. Also, if resizing is started by
clicking on the window border, the pointer is warped to the outer edge
of the border.
+

AddToFunc ResizeSE I Resize Direction SE
Mouse 3 A M ResizeSE
....

*Resize* [bottomright | br _x_ _y_]::
	An alternate syntax is used if the keyword _bottomright_ or in short
	_br_ follows the command name. In this case, the arguments _x_ and _y_
	specify the desired position of the bottom right corner of the window.
	They are interpreted exactly like the _x_ and _y_ arguments of the *Move*
	command. Actually, any of the options accepted by the *Move* command can
	be used.

*ResizeMaximize* [_resize-arguments_]::
	Combines the effects of *Resize* and *Maximize* in a single command.
	When used on a maximized window, the window is resized and is still in
	the maximized state afterwards. When used on an unmaximized window,
	the window is resized and put into the maximized state afterwards.
	This is useful if the user wants to resize the window temporarily and
	then return to the original geometry. The _resize-arguments_ are the
	same as for the *Resize* command.

*ResizeMove* _resize-arguments_ _move-arguments_::
	This command does the same as the *Resize* and *Move* commands, but in
	a single call which is less visually disturbing. The
	_resize-arguments_ are exactly the same arguments as for the *Resize*
	command and the _move-arguments_ are exactly the same arguments as for
	the *Move* command except the _pointer_ option which is not supported
	by the *ResizeMove* command.
+
Examples:
+

....
# Move window to top left corner and cover
# most of the screen
ResizeMove -10p -20p 0 0

# Grow the focused window towards the top of screen
Current Resize keep w+$[w.y]p keep 0
....

+
Note: Fvwm may not be able to parse the command properly if the option
_bottomright_ of the *Resize* command is used.

*ResizeMoveMaximize* _resize-arguments_ _move-arguments_::
	Combines the effects of *ResizeMove* and *Maximize* in a single
	command. When used on a maximized window, the window is resized and
	moved and is still in the maximized state afterwards. When used on an
	unmaximized window, the window is resized and put into the maximized
	state afterwards. This is useful if the user wants to resize the
	window temporarily and then return to the original geometry. The
	_resize-arguments_ and _move-arguments_ are the same as for the
	*ResizeMove* command.

*RestackTransients*::
	This command regroups the transients of a window close to it in the
	stacking order as if the window had just been lowered and then raised.
	The position of the window itself is not altered. Only windows that
	use either the _RaiseTransient_ or _LowerTransient_ style are affected
	at all. When *RestackTransients* is used on a transient window with
	the _StackTransientParent_ style set, it is redirected to the parent
	window.

*SetAnimation* _milliseconds-delay_ [_fractions-to-move-list_]::
	Sets the time between frames and the list of fractional offsets to
	customize the animated moves of the *AnimatedMove* command and the
	animation of menus (if the menu style is set to animated; see
	*MenuStyle* command). If the _fractions-to-move-list_ is omitted, only
	the time between frames is altered. The _fractions-to-move-list_
	specifies how far the window should be offset at each successive frame
	as a fraction of the difference between the starting location and the
	ending location. e.g.:
+

....
SetAnimation 10 -.01 0 .01 .03 .08 .18 .3 \
.45 .6 .75 .85 .90 .94 .97 .99 1.0
....

+
Sets the delay between frames to 10 milliseconds, and sets the
positions of the 16 frames of the animation motion. Negative values
are allowed, and in particular can be used to make the motion appear
more cartoonish, by briefly moving slightly in the opposite direction
of the main motion. The above settings are the default.

*SnapAttraction* [_proximity_ [_behaviour_] [Screen]]::
	The *SnapAttraction* command is obsolete. It has been replaced by the
	*Style* command option _SnapAttraction_.

*SnapGrid* [_x-grid-size_ _y-grid-size_]::
	The *SnapGrid* command is obsolete. It has been replaced by the
	*Style* command option _SnapGrid_.

*WindowsDesk* _arg1_ [_arg2_]::
	Moves the selected window to another desktop.
+
This command has been removed and must be replaced by *MoveToDesk*,
the arguments for which are the same as for the *GotoDesk* command.
+
*Important*
You cannot simply change the name of the command: the syntax has
changed. If you used:
+

....
WindowsDesk n
....

+
to move a window to desk n, you have to change it to:
+

....
MoveToDesk 0 n
....

*XorPixmap* [_pixmap_]::
	Selects the pixmap with which bits are xor'ed when doing rubber-band
	window moving or resizing. This has a better chance of making the
	rubber-band visible if *XorValue* does not give good results. An
	example pixmap _resize.rainbow.xpm_ is provided with the icon
	distribution. To turn the _XorPixmap_ off again use the *XorValue*
	command or omit the _pixmap_ argument.

*XorValue* [_number_]::
	Changes the value with which bits are xor'ed when doing rubber-band
	window moving or resizing. Valid values range from zero to the maximum
	value of an unsigned long integer on your system. Setting this value
	is a trial-and-error process. The default value 0 tries to find a
	value that gives a good contrast to black and white. The default value
	is used if the given _number_ is omitted or invalid.

=== Focus & Mouse Movement

*CursorMove* _horizontal_[p] _vertical_[p]::
	Moves the mouse pointer by _horizontal_ pages in the X direction and
	_vertical_ pages in the Y direction. Either or both entries may be
	negative. CursorMove can only move the mouse cursor to a relative
	position. To move the mouse cursor to an absolute position, see
	*WarpToWindow*. Both horizontal and vertical values are expressed in
	percent of pages, so
+

....
CursorMove 100 100
....

+
means to move down and right by one full page.
+

....
CursorMove 50 25
....

+
means to move right half a page and down a quarter of a page.
Alternatively, the distance can be specified in pixels by appending a
'_p_' to the horizontal and/or vertical specification. For example
+

....
CursorMove -10p -10p
....

+
means move ten pixels up and ten pixels left. The CursorMove function
should not be called from pop-up menus.

*FlipFocus* [NoWarp]::
	Executes a *Focus* command as if the user had used the pointer to
	select the window. This command alters the order of the WindowList in
	the same way as clicking in a window to focus, i.e. the target window
	is removed from the *WindowList* and placed at the start. This command
	is recommended for use with the *Direction* command and in the
	function invoked from *WindowList*.

*Focus* [NoWarp]::
	Sets the keyboard focus to the selected window. If the _NoWarp_
	argument is given, this is all it does. Otherwise it also moves the
	viewport or window as needed to make the selected window visible. This
	command does not automatically raise the window. Does not warp the
	pointer into the selected window (see *WarpToWindow* function). Does
	not de-iconify. This command does not alter the order of the
	*WindowList*, it rotates the *WindowList* around so that the target
	window is at the start.
+
When the _NoWarp_ argument is given, Focus cannot transfer the
keyboard focus to windows on other desks.
+
To raise and/or warp a pointer to a window together with *Focus* or
*FlipFocus*, use a function, like:
+

....
AddToFunc SelectWindow
+ I Focus
+ I Iconify false
+ I Raise
+ I WarpToWindow 50 8p
....

*WarpToWindow* [!raise | raise] _x_[p] _y_[p]::
	Warps the cursor to the associated window and raises it (unless the
	option _!raise_ is present). The parameters _x_ and _y_ default to
	percentage of window down and in from the upper left hand corner (or
	number of pixels down and in if '_p_' is appended to the numbers). If
	a number is negative the opposite edge is used and the direction
	reversed. This command works also with windows that are not managed by
	fvwm. In this case fvwm does not bring the window onto the screen if
	it is not visible. For example it is possible to warp the pointer to
	the center of the root window:
+

....
WindowId root WarpToWindow 50 50
....


=== Window State

*Close*::
	If the window accepts the delete window protocol a message is sent to
	the window asking it to gracefully remove itself. If the window does
	not understand the delete window protocol then the window is destroyed
	as with the *Destroy* command. Note: if the window accepts the delete
	window protocol but does not close itself in response, the window is
	not deleted.

*Delete*::
	Sends a message to a window asking that it remove itself, frequently
	causing the application to exit.

*Destroy*::
	Destroys an application window, which usually causes the application
	to crash and burn.

*Iconify* [_bool_]::
	Iconifies a window if it is not already iconified or de-iconifies it
	if it is already iconified. The optional argument _bool_ is a boolean
	argument. "_True_" means only iconification is allowed, while
	"_False_" forces de-iconification. Using "_toggle_" switches between
	iconified and de-iconified states.
+
There are a number of *Style* options which influence the appearance
and behavior of icons (e.g. _StickyIcon_, _NoIcon_).
+
For backward compatibility, the optional argument may also be a
positive number instead of "True", or a negative number instead of
"False". Note that this syntax is obsolete, and will be removed in the
future.

*Maximize* [_flags_] [_bool | forget_] [_horizontal_[p]] [_vertical_[p]]::
	Without its optional arguments (or if the _bool_ bit has the value
	"_toggle_") *Maximize* causes the window to alternately switch from a
	full-screen size to its normal size. To force a window into maximized
	(normal) state you can use a "_True_" or "_False_" value for the
	_bool_ argument.
+
With just the parameter "forget" a maximized window reverts back into
normal state but keeps its current maximized size. This can be useful
in conjunction with the commands *ResizeMaximize* and
*ResizeMoveMaximize*. If the window is not maximized, nothing happens.
+
With the optional arguments _horizontal_ and _vertical_, which are
expressed as percentage of a full screen, the user can control the new
size of the window. An optional suffix '_p_' can be used to indicate
pixels instead of percents of the screen size. If horizontal is
greater than 0 then the horizontal dimension of the window is set to
_horizontal_*screen_width/100. If the value is smaller than 0 the size
is subtracted from the screen width, i.e. -25 is the same as 75. If
_horizontal_ is "_grow_", it is maximized to current available space
until finding any obstacle. The vertical resizing is similar. If both
horizontal and vertical values are "grow", it expands vertically
first, then horizontally to find space. Instead of the horizontal
"grow" argument, "_growleft_" or "_growright_" can be used
respectively "_growup_" and "_growdown_". The optional _flags_
argument is a space separated list containing the following key words:
_fullscreen_, _ewmhiwa_, _growonwindowlayer_, _growonlayers_, _keepgrowing_,
and _screen_. _fullscreen_ causes the window to become fullscreened if the
appropriate EWMH hint is set. _ewmhiwa_ causes fvwm to ignore the EWMH
working area. _growonwindowlayer_ causes the various grow methods to
ignore windows with a layer other than the current layer of the window
which is maximized. The _growonlayers_ option must have two integer
arguments. The first one is the minimum layer and the second one the
maximum layer to use. Windows that are outside of this range of layers
are ignored by the grow methods. A negative value as the first or
second argument means to assume no minimum or maximum layer. _keepgrowing_
will allow the window to keep growing beyond any window it is currently
touching until it grows into the next closest window boundary. _screen_
must have an argument which specifies the screen on which to operate.
+
Here are some examples. The following adds a title-bar button to
switch a window to the full vertical size of the screen:
+

....
Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 0 100
....

+
The following causes windows to be stretched to the full width:
+

....
Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 100 0
....

+
This makes a window that is half the screen size in each direction:
+

....
Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 50 50
....

+
To expand a window horizontally until any other window is found:
+

....
Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 0 grow
....

+
To expand a window until any other window on the same or a higher
layer is hit.
+

....
Mouse 0 4 A Maximize growonlayers $[w.layer] -1 grow grow
....

+
To expand a window but leave the lower 60 pixels of the screen
unoccupied:
+

....
Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 100 -60p
....

+
Values larger than 100 can be used with caution.

*Refresh*::
	Causes all windows on the screen to redraw themselves. All pending
	updates of all windows' styles and looks are applied immediately. E.g.
	if *Style* or *TitleStyle* commands were issued inside a fvwm
	function.

*RefreshWindow*::
	Causes the chosen window to redraw itself. All pending updates of the
	window's style and look are applied immediately. E.g. if *Style* or
	*TitleStyle* commands were issued inside a fvwm function.

*Stick* [_bool_]::
	If the _bool_ argument is empty or "_toggle_", the *Stick* command
	makes a window sticky if it is not already sticky, or non-sticky if it
	is already sticky. To make a window sticky regardless of its current
	state the _bool_ argument must be "True". To make it non-sticky use
	"False".

*StickAcrossPages* [_bool_]::
	Works like *Stick* but only sticks a window across pages, not across desks.

*StickAcrossDesks* [_bool_]::
	Works like *Stick* but only sticks a window across desks, not across
	pages.

*WindowShade* [bool] | [[ShadeAgain] _direction_]::
	Toggles the window shade feature for titled windows. Windows in the
	shaded state only display a title-bar. If _bool_ is not given or
	"_toggle_", the window shade state is toggled. If _bool_ is "True",
	the window is forced to the shaded state. If _bool_ is "False", then
	the window is forced to the non-shaded state. To force shading in a
	certain direction, the _direction_ argument can be used. Any of the
	strings "_North_", "_South_", "_West_", "_East_", "_NorthWest_",
	"_NorthEast_", "_SouthWest_", "_SouthEast_" or "_Last_" can be given.
	The direction can be abbreviated with the usual one or two letters
	"_N_", "_NW_", etc. Using a direction on a window that was already
	shaded unshades the window. To shade it in a different direction, use
	the _ShadeAgain_ option. The direction _Last_ shades the window in the
	direction it last was shaded. If the window has never been shaded
	before it is shaded as if no direction had been given. Windows without
	titles can be shaded too. Please refer also to the options
	_WindowShadeSteps_, _WindowShadeShrinks_, _WindowShadeScrolls_,
	_WindowShadeLazy_, _WindowShadeAlwaysLazy_ and _WindowShadeBusy_
	options of the *Style* command. Examples:
+

....
Style * WindowShadeShrinks, WindowShadeSteps 20, \
  WindowShadeLazy
Mouse 1 - S WindowShade North
Mouse 1 [ S WindowShade West
Mouse 1 ] S WindowShade E
Mouse 1 _ S WindowShade S
....

+
Note: When a window that has been shaded with a _direction_ argument
changes the direction of the window title (see _TitleAtTop_ *Style*
option), the shading direction does not change. This may look very
strange. Windows that were shaded without a _direction_ argument stay
shaded in the direction of the title bar.
+
For backward compatibility, the optional argument may also be 1 to
signify "on", and 2 to signify "off". Note that this syntax is
obsolete, and will be removed in the future.

*WindowShadeAnimate* [_steps_ [p]]::
	This command is obsolete. Please use the _WindowShadeSteps_ option of
	the *Style* command instead.

=== Mouse & Key Bindings

*IgnoreModifiers* [_Modifiers_]::
	Tells fvwm which modifiers to ignore when matching Mouse or Key
	bindings. *IgnoreModifiers* affects the _ClickToFocus_ style too. This
	command belongs into your _config_. If you issue it when your fvwm
	session is already up and running the results are unpredictable. The
	should appear before any applications or modules are started in your
	_config_ file (e.g. with the *Exec* command).
+
_Modifiers_ has the same syntax as in the *Mouse* or *Key* bindings, with the
addition of 'L' meaning the caps lock key. The default is "L".  _Modifiers_
can be omitted, meaning no modifiers are ignored. This command comes in handy
if the num-lock and scroll-lock keys interfere with your shortcuts. With
XFree86 '2' usually is the num-lock  modifier and '5' refers to the
scroll-lock key. To turn all these pesky modifiers off you can use this command:
+

....
IgnoreModifiers L25
....

+
If the _Modifiers_ argument is the string "_default_", fvwm reverts
back to the default value "L".
+
*Important* This command creates a lot of extra network traffic,
depending on your CPU, network connection, the number of *Key* or
*Mouse* commands in your configuration file and the number of
modifiers you want to ignore. If you do not have a lightning fast
machine or very few bindings you should not ignore more than two
modifiers. I.e. do not ignore
+
if you have no problem with it. In the _FAQ_ you can find a better
solution of this problem.

*EdgeCommand* [screen _RANDRNAME_] [_direction_ [_Function_]]::
	Binds a specified fvwm command _Function_ to an edge of the screen.
	Direction may be one of "_North_", "_Top_", "_West_", "_Left_",
	"_South_", "_Bottom_", "_Right_" and "_East_". If _Function_ is
	omitted the binding for this edge is removed. If EdgeCommand is called
	without any arguments all edge bindings are removed. If the literal
	option _screen_ followed by a RandR screen name _RANDRNAME_ is given,
	the command is set only for the given monitor.
+
_Function_ is executed when the mouse pointer enters the invisible pan
frames that surround the visible screen. The binding works only if
*EdgeThickness* is set to a value greater than 0. If a function is
bound to an edge, scrolling specified by *EdgeScroll* is disabled for
this edge. It is possible to bind a function only to some edges and
use the other edges for scrolling. This command is intended to raise
or lower certain windows when the mouse pointer enters an edge.
*FvwmAuto* can be used get a delay when raising or lowering windows.
The following example raises *FvwmButtons* if the mouse pointer enters
the top edge of the screen.
+

....
# Disable EdgeScrolling but make it possible
# to move windows over the screen edge
EdgeResistance -1
Style * EdgeMoveDelay 250
Style * EdgeMoveResistance 20

# Set thickness of the edge of the screen to 1
EdgeThickness 1

# Give focus to FvwmButtons if the mouse
# hits top edge
EdgeCommand Top Next (FvwmButtons) Focus
# Make sure the Next command matches the window
Style FvwmButtons CirculateHit

Module FvwmButtons
Module FvwmAuto 100 "Silent AutoRaiseFunction" \
 "Silent AutoLowerFunction"

# If any window except FvwmButtons has
# focus when calling this function
# FvwmButtons are lowered
DestroyFunc AutoLowerFunction
AddToFunc AutoLowerFunction
+ I Current (!FvwmButtons) All (FvwmButtons) Lower

# If FvwmButtons has focus when calling this function raise it
DestroyFunc AutoRaiseFunction
AddToFunc AutoRaiseFunction
+ I Current (FvwmButtons) Raise
....

+
Normally, the invisible pan frames are only on the screen edges that
border virtual pages. If a screen edge has a command bound to it, the
pan frame is always created on that edge.

*EdgeLeaveCommand* [screen _RANDRNAME_] [_direction_ [_Function_]]::
	Binds a specified fvwm command _Function_ to an edge of the screen.
	Direction may be one of "_North_", "_Top_", "_West_", "_Left_",
	"_South_", "_Bottom_", "_Right_" and "_East_". If _Function_ is
	omitted the binding for this edge is removed. If EdgeLeaveCommand is
	called without any arguments all edge bindings are removed. If the
	literal option _screen_ followed by a RandR screen name _RANDRNAME_
	is given, the command is set only for the given monitor.

+
_Function_ is executed when the mouse pointer leaves the invisible pan
frames that surround the visible screen. The binding works only if
*EdgeThickness* is set to a value greater than 0. If a function is
bound to an edge, scrolling specified by *EdgeScroll* is disabled for
this edge. It is possible to bind a function only to some edges and
use the other edges for scrolling. This command is intended to raise
or lower certain windows when the mouse pointer leaves an edge.
*FvwmAuto* can be used get a delay when raising or lowering windows.
See example for *EdgeCommand*
+
Normally, the invisible pan frames are only on the screen edges that
border virtual pages. If a screen edge has a command bound to it, the
pan frame is always created on that edge.

*Key* [(_window_)] _Keyname_ _Context_ _Modifiers_ _Function_::
	Binds a keyboard key to a specified fvwm command, or removes the
	binding if _Function_ is '-'. The syntax is the same as for a *Mouse*
	binding except that the mouse button number is replaced with a
	_Keyname_. Normally, the key binding is activated when the key is
	pressed. _Keyname_ is a standard X11 key name as defined in
	_/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h_, (without the _XK__ prefix), or the
	keysym database _/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB_. Only key names that
	are generated with no modifier keys or with just the
+
key held are guaranteed to work. The _Context_ and _Modifiers_ fields
are defined as in the *Mouse* binding. However, when you press a key
the context window is the window that has the keyboard focus. That is
not necessarily the same as the window the pointer is over (with
_SloppyFocus_ or _ClickToFocus_). Note that key bindings with the
'_R_' (root window) context do not work properly with _SloppyFocus_
and _ClickToFocus_. If you encounter problems, use the *PointerKey*
command instead. If you want to bind keys to a window with
_SloppyFocus_ or _ClickToFocus_ that are supposed to work when the
pointer is not over the window, fvwm assumes the pointer is over the
client window (i.e. you have to use the 'W' context).
+
The special context '_M_' for menus can be used to (re)define the menu
controls. It be used alone or together with 'T', 'S', 'I', '[', ']',
'-' and '_'. See the *Menu Bindings* section for details.
+
The following example binds the built-in window list to pop up when
+
is hit, no matter where the mouse pointer is:
+

....
Key F11 A SCM WindowList
....

+
Binding a key to a title-bar button causes that button to appear.
Please refer to the *Mouse* command for details.

*Mouse* [(_window_)] _Button_ _Context_ _Modifiers_ _Function_::
	Defines a mouse binding, or removes the binding if _Function_ is '-'.
	_Button_ is the mouse button number. If _Button_ is zero then any
	button performs the specified function. Note that only mouse buttons 1
	to 5 are fully supported by X11. Any number above this works only
	partially. Complex functions can not be used with these buttons and
	neither any operation that requires dragging the pointer with the
	button held. This is due to limitations of X11. By default, the
	highest allowed button number is 9.
+
_Context_ describes where the binding applies. Valid contexts are
'_R_' for the root window, '_W_' for an application window, '_D_' for
a desktop application (as kdesktop or Nautilus desktop), '_T_' for a
window title-bar, '_S_' for a window side, top, or bottom bar, '_[_',
'_]_', '_-_' and '___' for the left, right, top or bottom side only,
'_F_' for a window frame (the corners), '<', '^', '>' and '_v_' for
the top left, top right, bottom right or bottom left corner, '_I_' for
an icon window, or '_0_' through '_9_' for title-bar buttons, or any
combination of these letters. '_A_' is for any context. For instance,
a context of "FST" applies when the mouse is anywhere in a window's
border except the title-bar buttons. Only 'S' and 'W' are valid for an
undecorated window.
+
The special context '_M_' for menus can be used to (re)define the menu
controls. It can be used alone or together with 'T', 'S', 'I', '[',
']', '-' and '_'. See the *Menu Bindings* section for details.
+
The special context '_P_' controls what buttons that can be used to
place a window. When using this context no modifiers are allowed
(_Modifiers_ must be N), no _window_ is allowed, and the _Function_
must be one of _PlaceWindow_, _PlaceWindowDrag_,
_PlaceWindowInteractive_, _CancelPlacement_, _CancelPlacementDrag_,
_CancelPlacementInteractive_ or _-_.
+
_PlaceWindow_ makes _Button_ usable for window placement, both for
interactive and drag move. _CancelPlacement_ does the inverse. That is
makes _Button_ to cancel move for both interactive and drag move. It
may however not override how new windows are resized after being
placed. This is controlled by the *Emulate* command. Also a window
being dragged can always be placed by releasing the button hold while
dragging, regardless of if it is set to _PlaceWindow_ or not.
+
_PlaceWindowDrag_ and _PlaceWindowInteractive_/_CancelPlacementDrag_
and _CancelPlacementInteractive_ work as
_PlaceWindow_/_CancelPlacement_ with the exception that they only
affect either windows dragged / placed interactively.
+
_-_ is equivalent to _CancelPlacement_.
+
The following example makes all buttons but button 3 usable for
interactive placement and makes drag moves started by other buttons
than one cancel if button 1 is pressed before finishing the move:
+

....
Mouse 0 P N PlaceWindow
Mouse 3 P N CancelPlacement
Mouse 1 P N CancelPlacementDrag
....

+
By default, the binding applies to all windows. You can specify that a
binding only applies to specific windows by specifying the window name
in brackets. The window name is a wildcard pattern specifying the
class, resource or name of the window you want the binding to apply
to.
+
The following example shows how the same key-binding can be used to
perform different functions depending on the window that is focused:
+

....
Key (rxvt)  V A C Echo ctrl-V-in-RXVT
Key (*term) V A C Echo ctrl-V-in-Term
Key (*vim)  V A C --
Key         V A C Echo ctrl-V-elsewhere
....

+
A '_--_' action indicates that the event should be propagated to the
specified window to handle. This is only a valid action for
window-specific bindings.
+
This example shows how to display the WindowList when Button 3 is
pressed on an rxvt window:
+

....
Mouse (rxvt) 3 A A WindowList
....

+
Note that Fvwm actually intercepts all events for a window-specific
binding and (if the focused window doesn't match any of the bindings)
sends a synthetic copy of the event to the window. This should be
transparent to most applications, however (for security reasons) some
programs ignore these synthetic events by default - xterm is one of
them. To enable handling of these events, add the following line to
your _~/.Xdefaults_ file:
+

....
XTerm*allowSendEvents:  true
....

+
_Modifiers_ is any combination of '_N_' for no modifiers, '_C_' for
control, '_S_' for shift, '_M_' for Meta, '_L_' for Caps-Lock or '_A_'
for any modifier. For example, a modifier of "SM" applies when both
the
+
and
+
keys are down. X11 modifiers mod1 through mod5 are represented as the
digits '1' through '5'. The modifier 'L' is ignored by default. To
turn it on, use the *IgnoreModifiers* command.
+
_Function_ is one of fvwm's commands.
+
The title-bar buttons are numbered with odd numbered buttons on the
left side of the title-bar and even numbers on the right.
Smaller-numbered buttons are displayed toward the outside of the
window while larger-numbered buttons appear toward the middle of the
window (0 is short for 10). In summary, the buttons are numbered:
+

....
1 3 5 7 9    0 8 6 4 2
....

+
The highest odd numbered button which has an action bound to it
determines the number of buttons drawn on the left side of the title
bar. The highest even number determines the number of right side
buttons which are drawn. Actions can be bound to either mouse buttons
or keyboard keys.

*PointerKey* [(_window_)] _Keyname_ _Context_ _Modifiers_ _Function_::
	This command works exactly like the *Key* command. The only difference
	is that the binding operates on the window under the pointer. Normal
	key bindings operate on the focused window instead. The *PointerKey*
	command can for example be used to bind keys to the root window if you
	are using _SloppyFocus_ or _ClickToFocus_. However, some applications
	(xterm is one example) are unable to handle this key anymore, even if
	the pointer is over the xterm window. It is recommended to use the
	*PointerKey* command only for key combinations that are not needed in
	any application window.
+
Example:
+

....
Style * SloppyFocus
PointerKey f1 a m Menu MainMenu

=== Controlling Window Styles

For readability, the commands in this section are not sorted
alphabetically. The description of the *Style* command can be found at
the end of this section.

*FocusStyle* _stylename_ _options_::
	works exactly like the *Style* command, but accepts only the focus
	policy related styles beginning with "FP". The prefix can be removed,
	but at the cost of a little bit of time. *FocusStyle* is meant to make
	the configuration file more readable. Example:
+

....
FocusStyle * EnterToFocus, !LeaveToUnfocus
....

+
is equivalent to
+

....
Style * FPEnterToFocus, !FPLeaveToUnfocus
....

*DestroyStyle* _style_::
	deletes the style named _style_. The changes take effect immediately.
	Note that _style_ is not a wild-carded search string, but rather a
	case-sensitive string that should exactly match the original *Style*
	command.
+
Destroying style "*" can be done, but isn't really to be recommended.
For example:
+

....
DestroyStyle Application*
....

+
This removes all settings for the style named "Application*", NOT all
styles starting with "Application".

*DestroyWindowStyle*::
	deletes the styles set by the *WindowStyle* command on the selected
	window. The changes take effect immediately.

*UpdateStyles*::
	All pending updates of all windows' styles and looks are applied
	immediately. E.g. if *Style*, _WindowStyle_ or _TitleStyle_ commands
	were issued inside a fvwm function.

*Style* _stylename_ _options_ ...::
	The *Style* command is used to set attributes of a window to values
	other than the default or to set the window manager default styles.
+
_stylename_ can be a window's name, class, visible name, or resource
string. It may contain the wildcards '*' and '?', which are matched in
the usual Unix filename manner. Multiple style options in a single
*Style* command are read from left to right as if they were issued one
after each other in separate commands. A given style always overrides
all conflicting styles that have been issued earlier (or further left
on the same style line).
+
Note: windows that have no name (WM_NAME) are given a name of
"Untitled", and windows that do not have a class (WM_CLASS, res_class)
are given class "NoClass" and those that do not have a resource
(WM_CLASS, res_name) are given resource "NoResource".
+
If a window has the resource "fvwmstyle" set, the value of that
resource is used in addition to any window names when selecting the
style.
+
_options_ is a comma separated list containing one or more of the
following keywords. Each group of style names is separated by slashes
('/'). The last style in these groups is the default. _BorderWidth_,
_HandleWidth_, _CornerLength_, _!Icon_ / _Icon_, _MiniIcon_,
_IconBox_, _IconGrid_, _IconFill_, _IconSize_, _!Title_ / _Title_,
_TitleAtBottom_ / _TitleAtLeft_ / _TitleAtRight_ /
_TitleAtTop_, _LeftTitleRotatedCW_ / _LeftTitleRotatedCCW_,
_RightTitleRotatedCCW_ / _RightTitleRotatedCW_,
_TopTitleRotated_ / _TopTitleNotRotated_, _BottomTitleRotated_ /

In the above list some options are listed as
style-option/opposite-style-option. The opposite-style-option for
entries that have them describes the fvwm default behavior and can be
used if you want to change the fvwm default behavior.
+
*Focus policy*;;
	_ClickToFocus_ instructs fvwm to give the focus to a window when it
	is clicked in. The default _MouseFocus_ (or its alias
	_FocusFollowsMouse_) tells fvwm to give a window the focus as soon
	as the pointer enters the window, and take it away when the pointer
	leaves the window. _SloppyFocus_ is similar, but doesn't give up the
	focus if the pointer leaves the window to pass over the root window
	or a ClickToFocus window (unless you click on it, that is), which
	makes it possible to move the mouse out of the way without losing
	focus. A window with the style _NeverFocus_ never receives the
	focus. This is useful for modules like *FvwmButtons*. for example.
	Note: Once any of the "FP..." styles has been used, the defaults
	that come with the basic focus policies are not restored when the
	latter are used again. For example, once !FPGrabFocus has been used,
	using ClickToFocus does not restore FPGrabFocus.
+
The focus model can be augmented with several additional options. In
fvwm-2.5.3 and later, there are a large number of advanced options
beginning with "FP" or "!FP". These options shall replace the older
options one day and are described first. Using any of these new
options may limit compatibility with older releases. In general,
options beginning with "FP" turn a feature on, while those beginning
with "!FP" turn it off.

*Focusing the window*;;
	With _FPEnterToFocus_, when the pointer enters a window it receives
	focus.
+
With _FPLeaveToUnfocus_ a window loses focus when the pointer leaves
it.
+
With _FPClickToFocus_, _FPClickDecorToFocus_ or
_FPClickIconToFocus_, a window receives focus when the inside of the
window or the decorations or its icon is clicked.
+
The _FPFocusByProgram_ style allows windows to take the focus
themselves.
+
The !_FPFocusByFunction_ style forbids that a window receives the
focus via the *Focus* and *FlipFocus* commands.
+
The _FPFocusByFunctionWarpPointer_ style controls if the pointer is
warped to a selected window when the *Focus* command is used.
+
_FPLenient_ allows focus on windows that do not want it, like
*FvwmPager* or xclock.
+
The _FPFocusClickButtons_ style takes a list of mouse buttons that
can be clicked to focus or raise a window when the appropriate style
is used. The default is to use the first three buttons ("123").
+
The _FPFocusClickModifiers_ style takes a list of modifier keys just
like the *Key* command. The exact combination of modifier keys must
be pressed for the click to focus or raise a window to work. The
default is to use no modifiers ("N").
+
With the _FPPassFocusClick_ style, the click that was used to focus
a window is passed to the application.
+
With the _FPAllowFocusClickFunction_ style, the click that was used
to focus a window can also trigger a normal action that was bound to
the window with the *Mouse* command).
+
If the _FPIgnoreFocusClickMotion_ style is used, clicking in a
window and then dragging the pointer with the button held down does
not count as the click to focus the window. Instead, the application
processes these events normally. This is useful to select text in a
terminal window with the mouse without raising the window. However,
mouse bindings on the client window are not guaranteed to work
anymore (see *Mouse* command). This style forces the initial click
to be passed to the application. The distance that the pointer must
be moved to trigger this is controlled by the *MoveThreshold*
command.
+
The _FPSortWindowlistByFocus_ and !_FPSortWindowlistByFocus_ styles
control whether the internal window list is sorted in the order the
windows were focused or in the order they were created. The latter
is the default for _ClickToFocus_ and _SloppyFocus_.
+
*Clicking the window to raise*
+
The styles _FPClickRaisesFocused_, _FPClickDecorRaisesFocused_ and
_FPClickIconRaisesFocused_ allow one to raise the window when the
interior or the decorations or the icon of the window is clicked
while the window is already focused.
+
The styles _FPClickRaisesUnfocused_, _FPClickDecorRaisesUnfocused_
and _FPClickIconRaisesUnfocused_ allow one to raise the window when
the interior or the decorations or the icon of the window is clicked
while the window is not yet focused.
+
With the _FPPassRaiseClick_ style, the click that was used to raise
the window is passed to the application.
+
With the _FPAllowRaiseClickFunction_ style, the click that was used
to raise the window can also trigger a normal action that was bound
to the window with the *Mouse* command.
+
If the _FPIgnoreRaiseClickMotion_ style is used, clicking in a
window and then dragging the pointer with the button held down does
not count as the click to raise the window. Instead, the application
processes these events normally. This is useful to select text in a
terminal window with the mouse without raising the window. However,
mouse bindings on the client window are not guaranteed to work
anymore (see *Mouse* command. Note that this style forces that the
initial click is passed to the application. The distance that the
pointer must be moved to trigger this is controlled by the
*MoveThreshold* command.
+
*Grabbing the focus when a new window is created*
+
New normal or transient windows with the _FPGrabFocus_ or
_FPGrabFocusTransient_ style automatically receive the focus when
they are created. _FPGrabFocus_ is the default for windows with the
_ClickToFocus_ style. Note that even if these styles are disabled,
the application may take the focus itself. Fvwm can not prevent
this.
+
The _OverrideGrabFocus_ style instructs fvwm to never take away the
focus from such a window via the _GrabFocus_ or _GrabFocusTransient_
styles. This can be useful if you like to have transient windows
receive the focus immediately, for example in a web browser, but not
while you are working in a terminal window or a text processor.
+
The above three styles are accompanied by _FPReleaseFocus_,
_FPReleaseFocusTransient_ and _FPOverrideReleaseFocus_. These
control if the focus is returned to another window when the window
is closed. Otherwise no window or the window under the pointer
receives the focus.
+
_ClickToFocusPassesClickOff_ and _ClickToFocusPassesClick_ controls
whether a mouse click to focus a window is sent to the application
or not. Similarly,
_ClickToFocusRaisesOff_/_MouseFocusClickRaisesOff_ and
_ClickToFocusRaises_/_MouseFocusClickRaises_ control if the window
is raised (but depending on the focus model).
+
Note: in fvwm versions prior to 2.5.3, the "Click..." options
applied only to windows with _ClickToFocus_ while the "Mouse..."
options applied to windows with a different focus policy. This is no
longer the case.
+
The old _GrabFocus_ style is equivalent to using _FPGrabFocus_ +
_FPReleaseFocus_.
+
The old _GrabFocusTransient_ style is equivalent to using
_FPGrabFocusTransient_ + _FPReleaseFocusTransient_.
+
_Lenience_ is equivalent to the new style _FPLenient_.

*Window title*::
	The _Title_ and !Title options determine whether the window is
        decorated with a title-bar. By default all windows have a title-bar.
        _NoTitle_ is equivalent to _!Title_ but is deprecated.
+
Windows with the _TitleAtBottom_, _TitleAtLeft_ or _TitleAtRight_
style have a title-bar below, to the left or to the right of the
window instead of above as usual. The _TitleAtTop_ style restores
the default placement. Even if the window has the _!Title_ style
set, this affects the *WindowShade* command. Please check the
*WindowShade* command for interactions between that command and
these styles. Titles on the left or right side of the windows are
augmented by the following styles:
+
Normally, the text in titles on the left side of a window is rotated
counterclockwise by 90 degrees from the normal upright position and
90 degrees clockwise for titles on the right side. It can also be
rotated in the opposite directions with _LeftTitleRotatedCW_ if
_TitleAtLeft_ is used, and with _RightTitleRotatedCCW_ if
_TitleAtRight_ is used. The defaults can be restored with
_LeftTitleRotatedCCW_ and _RightTitleRotatedCW_. A normal horizontal
text may be rotated as well with _TopTitleRotated_ if _TitleAtTop_
is used, and with _BottomTitleRotated_ if _TitleAtBottom_ is used.
The defaults can be restored with _TopTitleNotRotated_ and
_BottomTitleNotRotated_.
+
By default the title bar decoration defined using the *TitleStyle*
command is rotated following the title text rotation (see the
previous paragraph). This can be disabled by using the
!_UseTitleDecorRotation_ style. _UseTitleDecorRotation_ reverts back
to the default.
+
With the _StippledTitle_ style, titles are drawn with the same
effect that is usually reserved for windows with the _Sticky_,
_StickyAcrossPages_ or _StickyAcrossDesks_ style. _!StippledTitle_
reverts back to normal titles. _StippledTitleOff_ is equivalent to
_!StippledTitle_ but is deprecated.
+
*Colorset* takes the colorset number as its sole argument and
overrides the colors set by _Color_. Instead, the corresponding
colors from the given colorset are used. Note that all other
features of a colorset are not used. Use the *Colorset* decoration
style in the *TitleStyle* and _ButtonStyle_ command for that. To
stop using the colorset, the colorset number is omitted.
+
_BorderColorset_ takes eight positive integers as its arguments and will
apply the given colorsets to the eight individual components of the window
border.
+
For backwards compatibility, if one integer is supplied, that is applied to
all window border components.
+
The border is split up into the following definitions, and is the same order as
the colorsets which will be applied to the border.
+
....
BorderColorset North, North East, East, South East, South, South West, West, North West
....
+
_North_, _East_, _South_, and _West_ refer to the top, left, bottom, and right
sides of the window border.
+
_NE_, _SE_, _SW_, and _NW_ refer to the window handles.
+
*NOTE*: due to how window handles are rendered, there is no way to make one
complete edge of a window the same color as defined by either _North_, _South_,
_East_, or _West_.
+
The _HilightBorderColorset_ style option works the same as
_BorderColorset_ but is used when the window has the focus.
+
!_IconTitle_ disables displaying icon labels while the opposite
style _IconTitle_ enables icon labels (default behaviour).
_NoIconTitle_ is equivalent to _!IconTitle_ but is deprecated.
+
_IconTitleColorset_ takes the colorset number as its sole argument
and overrides the colors set by _Color_ or _Colorset_. To stop using
this colorset, the argument is omitted.
+
_HilightIconTitleColorset_ takes the colorset number as its sole
argument and overrides the colors set by _HilightColorset_.
To stop using this colorset, the argument is omitted.
+
_IconBackgroundColorset_ takes the colorset number as its sole
argument and uses it to set a background for the icon picture. By
default the icon picture is not drawn onto a background image. To
restore the default, the argument is omitted.
+
_IconTitleRelief_ takes one numeric argument that may be between -50
and +50 pixels and defines the thickness of the 3D relief drawn
around the icon title. With negative values the icon title gets a
pressed in look. The default is 2 and it is restored if the argument
is omitted.
+
_IconBackgroundRelief_ takes one numeric argument that may be
between -50 and +50 pixels and defines the thickness of the 3D
relief drawn around the icon picture background (if any). With
negative values the icon background gets a pressed in look. The
default is 2 and it is restored if the argument is omitted.
+
_IconBackgroundPadding_ takes one numeric argument that may be
between 0 and 50 pixels and defines the amount of free space between
the relief of the icon background picture (if any) and the icon
picture. The default is 2 and it is restored if the argument is
omitted.
+
The _Font_ and _IconFont_ options take the name of a font as their
sole argument. This font is used in the window or icon title. By
default the font given in the *DefaultFont* command is used. To
revert back to the default, use the style without the name argument.
These styles replace the older *WindowFont* and _IconFont_ commands.
+
The deprecated _IndexedWindowName_ style causes fvwm to use window
titles in the form
+

....
name (i)
....

+
where _name_ is the exact window name and _i_ is an integer which
represents the _i th_ window with _name_ as window name. This has
been replaced with:
+

....
TitleFormat %n (%t)
....

+
_ExactWindowName_ restores the default which is to use the exact
window name. Deprecated in favour of:
+

....
TitleFormat %n
....

+
_IndexedIconName_ and _ExactIconName_ work the same as
_IndexedWindowName_ and _ExactWindowName_ styles but for the icon
titles. Both are deprecated in favour of:
+

....
IconTitleFormat %n (%t)
IconTitleFormat %n
....

+
_TitleFormat_ describes what the visible name of a window should
look like, with the following placeholders being valid:
+
*%n*:::
	Insert the window's name.
*%i*:::
	Insert the window's icon name.
*%c*:::
	Insert the window's class name.
*%r*:::
	Insert the window's resource name.
*%t*:::
	Insert the window count.
*%I*:::
	Insert the window ID.
*%%*:::
	Insert a literal '%' character.
+
Any amount of whitespace may be used, along with other characters to
make up the string -- but a valid _TitleFormat_ string must contain
at least one of the placeholders mentioned. No quote stripping is
performed on the string, so for example the following is printed
verbatim:
+

....
TitleFormat " %n " -> [%t] ->      [%c]
....

+
Note: It's perfectly possible to use a _TitleFormat_ which can
result in wiping out the visible title altogether. For example:
+

....
TitleFormat %z
....

+
Simply because the placeholder '%z' isn't supported. This is not a
bug but rather a facet of how the formatting parser works.

+
_IconTitleFormat_ describes what the visible icon name of a window
should look like, with the options being the same as _TitleFormat_.

*Title buttons*::
	_Button_ and !_Button_ take a numeric argument which is the number
	of the title-bar button which is to be shown or omitted. _NoButton_
	is equivalent to _!Button_ but is deprecated.
+
_MwmButtons_ makes the *Maximize* button look pressed-in when the
window is maximized. See the _MwmDecorMax_ flag in *ButtonStyle* for
more information. To switch this style off again, use the
*FvwmButtons* style.

*Borders*::
	!_Borders_ suppresses the window border (but not the title)
	completely. The _Borders_ style enables them again. Without borders,
	all other styles affecting window borders are meaningless.
+
_MwmBorder_ makes the 3D bevel more closely match Mwm's.
_FvwmBorder_ turns off the previous option.
+
With the !_Handles_ style, the window does not get the handles in
the window corners that are commonly used to resize it. With
_!Handles_, the width from the _BorderWidth_ style is used. By
default, or if _Handles_ is specified, the width from the
_HandleWidth_ style is used. _NoHandles_ is equivalent to _!Handles_
but is deprecated.
+
_HandleWidth_ takes a numeric argument which is the width of the
border to place the window if it does have resize-handles. Using
_HandleWidth_ without an argument restores the default.
+
_CornerLength_ takes a single numeric argument which is the length,
in pixels, of the corner handles. The default is the title height.
Using _CornerLength_ without an argument restores the default.
+
_BorderWidth_ takes a numeric argument which is the width of the
border to place the window if it does not have resize-handles. It is
used only if the _!Handles_ style is specified too. Using
_BorderWidth_ without an argument restores the default.
+
_DepressableBorder_ makes the border parts of the window decoration
look sunken in when a button is pressed over them. This can be
disabled again with the _FirmBorder_ style.

*Icons, shading, maximizing, movement, resizing*::
	_Icon_ takes an (optional) unquoted string argument which is the
	icon bitmap or pixmap to use. Icons specified this way override
	pixmap icons, but not icon windows or the ewmh icon, provided by the
	client in the application (with the WM_HINTS property or with the
	ewmh _NET_WM_ICON property). The __IconOverride__ style changes the
	behavior to override any client-provided icons; the __NoIconOverride__
	style changes the behavior to not override any client-provided
	icons; the default overriding behavior can be activated with the
	__NoActiveIconOverride__ style. With this style, fvwm uses application
	provided icons if the icon is changed but uses the icon provided in
	the configuration file until then.
+
There is one exception to these rules, namely
+

....
Style * Icon unknown.xpm
....

+
doesn't force the unknown.xpm icon on every window, it just sets the
default icon like the DefaultIcon command. If you really want all
windows to have the same icon, you can use
+

....
Style ** Icon unknown.xpm
....

+
If the _NoIcon_ attribute is set then the specified window simply
disappears when it is iconified. The window can be recovered through
the window-list. If _Icon_ is set without an argument then the
_NoIcon_ attribute is cleared but no icon is specified. An example
which allows only the *FvwmPager* module icon to exist:
+

....
Style * NoIcon
Style FvwmPager Icon
....

+
_IconBox_ takes no argument, four numeric arguments (plus optionally
a screen specification), an X11 geometry string or the string
"none":
+

....
IconBox [screen scr-spec] l t r b
....

+
or
+

....
IconBox geometry
....

+
Where _l_ is the left coordinate, _t_ is the top, _r_ is right and
_b_ is bottom. Negative coordinates indicate distance from the right
or bottom of the screen. If the first argument is the word _screen_,
the _scr-spec_ argument specifies the RandR screen on which the
IconBox is defined ´or the additional 'w' for the screen where the
window center is located. This is only useful with multiple screens.
The "l t r b" specification is more flexible than an X11 geometry.
For example:
+

....
IconBox -80 240 -1 -1
....

+
defines a box that is 80 pixels wide from the right edge, 240 pixels
down from the top, and continues to the bottom of the screen.
+
Perhaps it is easier to use is an X11 geometry string though:
+

....
IconBox 1000x70-1-1
....

+
places an 1000 by 70 pixel icon box on the bottom of the screen
starting in the lower right hand corner of the screen. One way to
figure out a geometry like this is to use a window that resizes in
pixel increments, for example, xv. Then resize and place the xv
window where you want the iconbox. Then use FvwmIdent to read the
windows geometry. The icon box is a region of the screen where fvwm
attempts to put icons for any matching window, as long as they do
not overlap other icons. Multiple icon boxes can be defined as
overflow areas. When the first icon box is full, the second one is
filled. All the icon boxes for one style must be defined in one
*Style* command. For example:
+

....
Style * IconBox -80 240 -1 -1, \
  IconBox 1000x70-1-1
....

+
A Style command with the IconBox option replaces any icon box
defined previously by another Style command for the same style.
That's why the backslash in the previous example is required.
+
Note: The geometry for the icon box command takes the additional
screen specifier "@w" in case RandR is used. This designates the
screen where the window center is located. The additional screen
specifier is not allowed anywhere else.
+
If you never define an icon box, or you fill all the icon boxes,
fvwm has a default icon box that covers the screen, it fills top to
bottom, then left to right, and has an 80x80 pixel grid. To disable
all but the default icon box you can use IconBox without arguments
in a separate *Style* command. To disable all icon boxes including
the default icon box, the argument "none" can be specified.
+
Hint: You can auto arrange your icons in the icon box with a simple
fvwm function. Put the "DeiconifyAndRearrange" function below in
your configuration file:
+

....
AddToFunc DeiconifyAndRearrange
 + C Iconify off
 + C All (CurrentPage, Iconic) PlaceAgain Icon
....

+
And then replace all places where you call the *Iconify* command to
de-iconify an icon with a call to the new function. For example
replace
+

....
AddToFunc IconFunc
 + C Iconify off
 + M Raise
 + M Move
 + D Iconify off

Mouse 1 I A Iconify off
....

+
with
+

....
AddToFunc IconFunc
 + C DeiconifyAndRearrange
 + M Raise
 + M Move
 + D DeiconifyAndRearrange

Mouse 1 I A DeiconifyAndRearrange
....

+
_IconGrid_ takes 2 numeric arguments greater than zero.
+

....
IconGrid x y
....

+
Icons are placed in an icon box by stepping through the icon box
using the _x_ and _y_ values for the icon grid, looking for a free
space. The default grid is 3 by 3 pixels which gives a tightly
packed appearance. To get a more regular appearance use a grid
larger than your largest icon. Use the _IconSize_ argument to clip
or stretch an icon to a maximum size. An _IconGrid_ definition must
follow the *IconBox* definition that it applies to:
+

....
Style * IconBox -80x240-1-1, IconGrid 90 90
....

+
_IconFill_ takes 2 arguments.
+

....
IconFill Bottom Right
....

+
Icons are placed in an icon box by stepping through the icon box
using these arguments to control the direction the box is filled in.
By default the direction is left to right, then top to bottom. This
would be expressed as:
+

....
IconFill left top
....

+
To fill an icon box in columns instead of rows, specify the vertical
direction (top or bottom) first. The directions can be abbreviated
or spelled out as follows: "t", "top", "b", "bot", "bottom", "l",
"lft", "left", "r", "rgt", "right". An *IconFill* definition must
follow the *IconBox* definition that it applies to:
+

....
Style * IconBox -80x240-1-1, IconFill b r
....

+
_IconSize_ sets limits on the size of an icon image. Both
user-provided and application-provided icon images are affected.
+

....
IconSize [ width height [ maxwidth maxheight ] ]
....

+
All arguments are measured in pixels. When all four arguments are
passed to _IconSize,_ _width_ and _height_ represent the minimum
size of an icon, and _maxwidth_ and _maxheight_ represent the
maximum size of an icon. Icon images that are smaller than the
minimum size are padded. Icon images that are bigger than the
maximum size are clipped.
+
If only two arguments are passed to _IconSize,_ _width_ and _height_
represent the absolute size of an icon. Icons covered by this style
are padded or clipped to achieve the given size.
+
If no arguments are specified, the default values are used for each
dimension. This effectively places no limits on the size of an icon.
+
The value of "-1" can be used in place of any of the arguments to
specify the default value for that dimension.
+
In addition to the numeric arguments, 1 additional argument can be
"Stretched", "Adjusted", or "Shrunk".
+
Note that module provided icon managers are not affected by this
style.
+
_MiniIcon_ specifies a pixmap to use as the miniature icon for the
window. This miniature icon can be drawn in a title-bar button (see
*ButtonStyle*), and can be used by various fvwm modules (*FvwmIconMan*
and *FvwmPager*). It takes the name of a pixmap as an argument.
+
_WindowShadeShrinks_ and _WindowShadeScrolls_ control if the contents
of a window that is being shaded with the *WindowShade* command are
scrolled (default) or if they stay in place. The shrinking mode is a
bit faster
+
The _WindowShadeSteps_ option selects the number of steps for
animation when shading a window with *WindowShade*. It takes one
number as its argument. If the number has a trailing '_p_' it sets the
number of pixels to use as the step size instead of a fixed number of
steps. 0 disables the animation. This happens too if the argument is
omitted or invalid.
+
The *WindowShade* command has two modes of operation: busy and lazy
shading. Busy shading can be 50% slower than lazy shading, but the
latter can look strange under some conditions, for example, if the
window borders, buttons or the title are filled with a tiled pixmap.
Also, the window handles are not drawn in lazy mode and the border
relief may only be drawn partially right before the window reaches the
shaded state or tight after leaves the unshaded state. By default,
fvwm uses lazy mode if there are no bad visual effects (not counting
the window handles) and busy mode otherwise. Use the
_WindowShadeAlwaysLazy or WindowShadeBusy_ to force using the lazy or
busy mode. The default setting is restored with _WindowShadeLazy_.
+
_ResizeOpaque_ instructs fvwm to resize the corresponding windows with
their contents visible instead of using an outline. Since this causes
the application to redraw frequently it can be quite slow and make the
window flicker excessively, depending on the amount of graphics the
application redraws. The _ResizeOutline_ style (default) negates the
_ResizeOpaque_ style. Many applications do not like their windows
being resized opaque, e.g. XEmacs, Netscape or terminals with a pixmap
background. If you do not like the result, do not use the
_ResizeOpaque_ style for these windows. To exempt certain windows from
opaque resizing you could use these lines in your configuration file:
+

....
Style * ResizeOpaque
Style rxvt ResizeOutline
Style emacs ResizeOutline
....

+
_Sticky_ makes the window sticky, i.e. it is always visible on each
page and each desk. The opposite style, _Slippery_ reverts back to the
default.
+
_StickyIcon_ makes the window sticky when it's iconified. It
de-iconifies on top the active desktop. _SlipperyIcon_ reverts back to
the default.
+
_StickyAcrossPages_ and _StickyAcrossPagesIcon_ work like _Sticky_ and
_StickyIcon_, but stick the window only across pages, not desks while
_StickyAcrossDesks and StickyAcrossDesksIcon_ works the other way
round.
+
Windows that have been marked as _Sticky_ or _StickyAcrossDesks_ or
_StickyAcrossPages_ will have stipples drawn on the titlebar. This can
be negated with the !_StickyStippledTitle_ style. The style
_StickyStippledTitle_ puts back the stipples where that window has
also been marked as _Sticky_. Note that this is the default style for
_Sticky_ windows. Sticky icons will have stipples drawn on the icon
title. This can be disabled in the same way with the
!_StickyStippledIconTitle_ style.
+
Windows with the _StartIconic_ style are shown as icons initially.
Note that some applications counteract that by deiconifying
themselves. The default is to not iconify windows and can be set with
the _StartNormal_ style.
+
_StickyIcon_ makes the window sticky when it's iconified. It
de-iconifies on top the active desktop. _SlipperyIcon_ reverts back to
the default.
+
_StickyIconPage_ works like _StickyIcon_, but sticks the icon only
across pages, not desks while _StickyIconDesk_ works the other way
round.
+
_StippledIconTitle_ works like _StippledTitle_ in that it draws
stipples on the titles of icons but doesn't make the icon sticky.
+
_IgnoreRestack_ makes fvwm ignore attempts of clients to raise or
lower their own windows. By default, the opposite style,
_AllowRestack_ is active.
+
_FixedPosition_ and _FixedUSPosition_ make fvwm ignore attempts of the
user to move the window. It is still possible to move the window by
resizing it. To allow the user to move windows, use the
_VariablePosition_ or _VariableUSPosition_ style.
+
_FixedSize_ and _FixedUSSize_ make fvwm ignore attempts of the user to
resize the window. To allow the user to resize windows, use the
_VariableSize_ or _VariableUSSize_ style.
+
_FixedPPosition_ and _FixedPSize_ make fvwm ignore attempts of the
program to move or resize its windows. To allow this kind of actions,
use the _VariablePPosition_ or _VariablePSize_ style. These styles may
sometimes affect the initial placement and dimensions of new windows
(depending on the application). If windows are created at strange
places, try either the _VariablePPosition_ or _!UsePPosition_ styles.
The _FixedPSize_ style may screw up window dimensions for some
applications. Do Not use this style in this case.
+
_MoveByProgramMethod_ affects how fvwm reacts to requests by the
application to move its windows. By default, fvwm tries to detect
which method to use, but it sometimes detects the wrong method. You
may come across a window that travels across the screen by a few
pixels when the application resizes it, moves to a screen border with
the frame decorations off screen, that remembers its position for the
next time it starts but appears in a slighly shifted position, or that
attepmts to become full screen but has the. Try out both options,
_UseGravity_ and _IgnoreGravity_ on the window (and that window only)
and see if that helps. By default, fvwm uses the _AutoDetect_ method.
Once the method was detected, it is never changed again. As long as
fvwm can not detect the proper method, it uses _IgnoreGravity_. To
force fvwm to retry the detection, use one of the other two options
first and then use _AutoDetect_ again.
+
Note: This option was introduced to alleviate a problem with the ICCCM
specification. The ICCCM clearly states that the _UseGravity_ option
should be used, but traditionally applications ignored this rule.
+
_Closable_ enables the functions *Close*, *Delete* and *Destroy* to be
performed on the windows. This is on by default. The opposite,
_!Closable_, inhibits the window to be closed.
+
_Iconifiable_ enables the function *Iconify* to be performed on the
windows. This is on by default. The opposite, _!Iconifiable_, inhibits
the window from being iconified.
+
_Maximizable_ enables the function *Maximize* to be performed on the
windows. This is on by default. The opposite, _!Maximizable_, inhibits
the window from being maximized.
+
_AllowMaximizeFixedSize_ enables the function *Maximize* to be
performed on windows that are not resizable, unless maximization has
been disabled either using the style _!Maximizable_ or through WM
hints. This is on by default. The opposite, _!AllowMaximizeFixedSize_,
inhibits all windows that are not resizable from being maximized.
+
_ResizeHintOverride_ instructs fvwm to ignore the program supplied
minimum and maximum size as well as the resize step size (the
character size in many applications). This can be handy for broken
applications that refuse to be resized. Do not use it if you do not
need it. The default (opposite) style is _NoResizeOverride_.
+
_MinWindowSize [ width [ p | c ] height [ p | c ] ]_ Tells fvwm the
minimum width and height of a window. The values are the percentage of
the total screen area. If the letter '_p_' is appended to either of the
values, the numbers are interpreted as pixels. If the letter '_c_' is
appended to either of the values, the numbers are in terms of the client
window's size hints, which can be useful for windows such as terminals to
specify the number of rows or columns. This command is useful to deal with
windows that freak out if their window becomes too small. If you omit the
parameters or their values are invalid, both limits are set to 0 pixels
(which is the default value).
+
_MaxWindowSize [ width [ p | c ] height [ p | c ] ]_ Tells fvwm the
maximum width and height of a window. The values are the percentage of
the total screen area. If the letter '_p_' is appended to either of the
values, the numbers are interpreted as pixels. If the letter '_c_' is
appended to either of the values, the numbers are in terms of the client
window's size hints, which can be useful for windows such as terminals to
specify the number of rows or columns. This command is useful to force
large application windows to be fully visible. Neither _height_ nor _width_
may be less than 100 pixels. If you omit the parameters or their values
are invalid, both limits are set to 32767 pixels (which is the default).
+
With _IconifyWindowGroups_ all windows in the same window group are
iconified and deiconified at once when any window in the group is
(de)iconified. The default is _IconifyWindowGroupsOff_, which disables
this behavior. Although a number of applications use the window group
hint, it is rarely used in a proper way, so it is probably best to use
_IconifyWindowGroups_ only for selected applications.
+
The option _SnapAttraction_ affects interactive window movement: If
during an interactive move the window or icon comes within _proximity_
pixels of another the window or icon, it is moved to make the borders
adjoin. The default of 0 means that no snapping happens. Calling this
command without arguments turns off snap attraction and restores the
default behavior. Please refer also to the _SnapGrid_ option.
+
The second argument optional and may be set to one of
the five following values: With _All_ both icons and windows snap to
other windows and other icons. _SameType_ lets windows snap only to
windows, and icons snap only to icons. With _Windows_ windows snap
only to other windows. Similarly with _Icons_ icons snap only to other
icons. With _None_ no snapping takes place. This option can be useful
in conjunction with the thirs argument if you only want to snap
against the screen edges. The default behavior is _All_.
+
The third and last optional argument may be set to one of the four
following values:
+
--
* With _Screen_ the already snapping icons or windows, which is
controlled by the second argument, will snap now also to the screen
edges.
* _ScreenWindows_ snaps only windows to the screen edges.
* _ScreenIcons_ snaps only icons to the screen edges.
* _ScreenAll_ snaps windows and icons to the screen edges.
--
+
The option _SnapGrid_ defines an invisible grid on the screen. During
an interactive move a window or icon is positioned such that its
location (top left corner) is coincident with the nearest grid point.
The default _x-grid-size_ and _y-grid-size_ setting are both 1, which
is effectively no grid all.
+
An interactive move with both _SnapGrid_ and _SnapAttraction_ results
in the window being moved to be adjacent to the nearest window border
(if within snap proximity) or grid position. The window moves the
shortest distance possible to satisfy both _SnapGrid_ and
_SnapAttraction_. Note that the x and y coordinates are not coupled.
For example, a window may snap to another window on the x axis while
snapping to a grid point on the y axis. Using this style without
arguments reinstates the default settings.
+
The styles _EdgeMoveDelay_ and _EdgeResizeDelay_ define how hard it
is to change the desktop viewport by moving or resizing a
window over the edge of the screen. The parameter tells how many
milliseconds the pointer must spend on the screen edge before fvwm
moves the viewport. The command *EdgeScroll* determines how far the
viewport is scrolled. If -1 is given as the delay, page flipping is
disabled completely. The defaults are no delay for moving (0) and no
flipping for resizing (-1). Using these styles without any argument
restores the default settings. Note that, with
+
....
EdgeScroll 0 0
....
+
it is still possible to move or resize windows across the edge of the
current screen. See also *EdgeThickness*.
+
The option _EdgeMoveResistance_ makes it easier to place a window
directly adjacent to a RandR screen's edge. It takes one or two parameters.
The first parameter tells how many pixels over an outside edge of the
screen a window's edge must move before it actually moves partially off
the screen. The optional second parameter does the same as the first, but
for inside edges (shared edge between two RandR monitors). If omitted,
there is no resistance between inside edges. Note that the center of the
window being moved determines the screen on which the window should be
kept. Both values are 0 (no resistance) by default. To restore the defaults,
the option _EdgeMoveResistance_ can be used without any parameters.
+
The option _InitialMapCommand_ allows for any valid fvwm command or
function to run when the window is initially mapped by fvwm. Example:
+
....
Style MyWindow StartsOnPage 0 0, InitialMapCommand Iconify
....
+
This would hence place the window called _MyWindow_ on page 0 0 for
the current desk, and immediately run the *Iconify* command on that
window.
+
Note that should _InitialMapCommand_ be used as a global option for
all windows, but there is a need that some windows should not have
this command applied, then an action of *Nop* can be used on those
windows, as in the following example:
+
....
Style * InitialMapCommand Iconify
Style XTeddy InitialMapCommand Nop
....

*Window Manager placement*::
	Applications can place windows at a particular spot on the screen
	either by window manager hints or a geometry specification. When they
	do neither, then the window manager steps in to find a place for the
	window. Fvwm knows several ways to deal with this situation. The
	default is _TileCascadePlacement_.
+
_PositionPlacement_ [__Center__|__UnderMouse__|_move-arguments_] When
used without an argument, new windows are placed in the top left
corner of the display. With the argument _Center_, all new window
appear at the center of the screen, and with _UnderMouse_, windows are
centered under the mouse pointer where possible. If the window is
unable to fit on the screen because the pointer is at the edge of the
screen, then the window is forced on-screen using this option. If any
other _move-arguments_ are given, they are interpreted exactly as the
*Move* command does (with the exception that references to the current
window position do not work as the window has not been placed yet).
+
_CascadePlacement_ automatically place new windows in a cascading
fashion.
+
_TileCascadePlacement_ automatically places new windows in a smart
location - a location in which they do not overlap any other windows
on the screen. If no such position can be found _CascadePlacement_ is
used as a fall-back method.
+
_TileManualPlacement_ This is the same as _TileCascadePlacement_, but
uses _ManualPlacement_ as the fall-back method.
+
_MinOverlapPlacement_ automatically places new windows in a location
in which the overlapping area in pixels of other windows is minimized.
By default this placement policy tries to avoid overlapping icons and
windows on higher layers. This can be configured with the
_MinOverlapPlacementPenalties_ style.
+
_MinOverlapPercentPlacement_ is similar to _MinOverlapPlacement_ but
tries to minimize the overlapped percentages of other windows instead
of the overlapped area in pixels. This placement policy tries to avoid
covering other windows completely and tries even harder not to cover
small windows. This can be configured with the
_MinOverlapPlacementPenalties_ and
_MinOverlapPercentPlacementPenalties_ styles.
+
_MinOverlapPlacementPenalties_ takes at most 6 positive or null
decimal arguments:
+

....
normal ontop icon sticky below strut
....

+
if trailing arguments are missing the default is used which is:
+

....
1 5 10 1 0.05 50
....

+
To reset this style to the default values, prefix it with a '!'. This
style configures the _MinOverlapPlacement_ and
_MinOverlapPercentPlacement_ placement policy. The _normal_ factor
affects normal windows, the _ontop_ factor affects windows with a
greater layer than the window being placed, the _icon_ factor affects
icons, the _sticky_ factor affects sticky windows, the _below_ factor
affects windows with a smaller layer than the window being placed, the
_strut_ factor affects the complement of the EWMH working area if the
window being placed has the _EWMHPlacementUseWorkingArea_ style and
windows with an EWMH strut hint (i.e., a "please do not cover me"
hint) if the window being placed has the
_EWMHPlacementUseDynamicWorkingArea_ style. These factors represent
the amount of area that these types of windows (or area) are counted
as, when a new window is placed. For example, by default the area of
ontop windows is counted 5 times as much as normal windows. So
_MinOverlapPlacement_ and _MinOverlapPercentPlacement_ covers 5 times
as much area of another window before it will cover an ontop window.
To treat ontop windows the same as other windows, set this to 1. To
really, really avoid putting windows under ontop windows, set this to
a high value, say 1000. This style affects the window already mapped
and not the window which is currently placed. There is one exception
to this rule: in the case of the window being placed has the
_EWMHPlacementUseWorkingArea_ style the _strut_ factor affects the
placed window.
+
_MinOverlapPercentPlacementPenalties_ takes at most 4 positive or null
integer arguments:
+

....
cover_100 cover_95 cover_85 cover_75
....

+
if trailing arguments are missing the defaults are used which are:
+

....
12 6 4 1
....

+
To reset this style to the default values, prefix it with a '!'. This
style affects the _MinOverlapPercentPlacement_ placement policy and is
similar to the _MinOverlapPlacementPenalties_ style. The _cover_xx_
factor is used when the window being placed covers at least _xx_
percent of the window. This factor is added to the factor determined
by the _MinOverlapPlacementPenalties_ style.
+
_ManualPlacement_ (aka active placement). The user is required to
place every new window manually. The window only shows as a rubber
band until a place is selected manually. The window is placed when a
mouse button or any key except _Escape_ is pressed. Escape aborts
manual placement which places the window in the top left corner of the
screen. If mouse button 2 is pressed during the initial placement of a
window (respectively _Shift_ and mouse button 1 in case Mwm emulation
has been enabled with the *Emulate* command), the user is asked to
resize the window too.
+
It is possible to define buttons usable to place windows with the
*Move* command and the special context 'P' for placement (see *Move*
command). However, you can't redefine the way to also resize the
window other than the way it is affected by the *Emulate* command. The
button used for placing the window can be checked with the
_PlacedByButton_ condition (see *Current* command).
+
Example:
+

....
Style * ManualPlacement

*FvwmEvent: PassID
*FvwmEvent: add_window GrowDownFunc
AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I FvwmEvent

AddToFunc GrowDownFunc
+ I windowid $0 (PlacedByButton 3) \
Resize bottomright keep -0p
....

+
Now, whenever a window is created and the user presses button 3 to
finish initial placement, the window is automatically enlarged until
it hits the bottom screen border.
+
_Old placement styles_ DumbPlacement / SmartPlacement /
SmartPlacementOff, CleverPlacement / CleverPlacementOff,
ActivePlacement / RandomPlacement, ActivePlacementsHonorsStartsOnPage
/ ActivePlacementsHonorsStartsOnPageOff are
still supported but will be removed in the future. The old and new

*Placement policy options and window stacking*::
	_!UsePPosition_ instructs fvwm to ignore the program specified
	position (PPosition hint) when adding new windows. Using PPosition is
	required for some applications, but if you do not have one of those
	it's a real headache. Many programs set PPosition to something
	obnoxious like 0,0 (upper left corner). Note: _!UsePPosition_ is
	equivalent to the deprecated option _!UsePPosition_
+
_!UseUSPosition_ works like _!UsePPosition_ but applies suppresses
using the user specified position indicated by the program (USPosition
hint). It is generally a bad thing to override the user's choice, but
some applications misuse the USPosition hint to force their windows to
a certain spot on the screen without the user's consent. Note:
_!UseUSPosition_ is equivalent to the deprecated option _!USPosition_
+
_NoUseTransientPPosition_ and _UseTransientPPosition_ work like
_!UsePPosition_ and _UsePPosition_ but apply only to transient
windows. Note: _!UseTransientPPosition_ is equivalent to the
deprecated option _!TransientPPosition_
+
_NoUseIconPosition_ instructs fvwm to ignore the program specified
icon position (IconPosition hint) when iconifying the window. Note:
_!UseIconPosition_ is equivalent to the deprecated option
_!IconPosition_
+
_StartsOnDesk_ takes a numeric argument which is the desktop number on
which the window should be initially placed. Note that standard Xt
programs can also specify this via a resource (e.g. "-xrm '*Desk:
1'").
+
_StartsOnPage_ takes 1, 2, or 3 numeric arguments. If one or three
arguments are given, the first (or only) argument is the desktop
number. If three arguments are given, the 2nd and 3rd arguments
identify the x,y page position on the virtual window. If two arguments
are given, they specify the page position, and indicate no desk
preference. If only one argument is given, _StartsOnPage_ functions
exactly like _StartsOnDesk_. For those standard Xt programs which
understand this usage, the starting desk/page can also be specified
via a resource (e.g., "-xrm '*page: 1 0 2'"). _StartsOnPage_ in
conjunction with _SkipMapping_ is a useful technique when you want to
start an app on some other page and continue with what you were doing,
rather than waiting for it to appear.
+
_StartsOnScreen_ takes one argument. It must be a valid RandR name. A
new window is placed on the specified screen. The default is to place
windows on the screen that contains the mouse pointer at the time the
window is created. However, those windows which are not placed by fvwm
(i.e., those with a USPosition hint from a user specified geometry)
are normally placed in a position relative to all identified screens.
+
_StartsOnPageIncludesTransients_ causes the _StartsOnPage_ style to be
applied even for transient windows. This is not usually useful, since
transients are usually pop ups that you want to appear in your visible
viewport; but occasionally an application uses a transient for
something like a startup window that needs to be coerced into place.
+
_ManualPlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage_ suppresses _StartsOnPage_ or
_StartsOnDesk_ placement in the event that both _ManualPlacement_ and
_SkipMapping_ are in effect when a window is created. This prevents
you from interactively placing a window and then wondering where it
disappeared to, because it got placed on a different desk or page.
_ManualPlacementHonorsStartsOnPage_ allows this to happen anyway. The
option has no effect if _SkipMapping_ is not in effect, because fvwm
switches to the proper desk/page to perform interactive placement. The
default is _ManualPlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage_;
_ManualPlacementHonorsStartsOnPage_ matches the way the old
_StartsOnDesk_ style used to handle the situation.
+
_CaptureHonorsStartsOnPage_ causes the initial capture (of an already
existing window) at startup to place the window according to the
_StartsOnPage_ and _StartsOnScreen_ desk, page and screen
specification. _CaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage_ causes fvwm to ignore
these settings (including _StartsOnDesk_) on initial capture. The
default is _CaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage_.
+
_RecaptureHonorsStartsOnPage_ causes a window to be placed according
to, or revert to, the _StartsOnPage_ and _StartsOnScreen_ desk, page
and screen specification on *Restart*. _RecaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage_
causes fvwm to respect the current window position on *Restart*. The
default is _RecaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage_.
+
_Layer_ accepts one optional argument: a non-negative integer. This is
the layer the window is put in. If no argument is given, any
previously set value is deleted and the default layer is implied.
+
_StaysOnTop_ puts the window in the top layer. This layer can be
changed by the command *DefaultLayers*; the default is 6.
+
_StaysPut_ puts the window in the put layer. This layer can be changed
by the command *DefaultLayers*; the default is 4.
+
_StaysOnBottom_ puts the window in the bottom layer. This layer can be
changed by the command *DefaultLayers*; the default is 2.
+
_StartsLowered_ instructs fvwm to put the window initially at the
bottom of its layer rather than the default _StartsRaised_.
+
_StartShaded_ tells fvwm to shade the window. An optional direction
argument may be given, which can be one of "_North_", "_South_",
"_West_", "_East_", "_NorthWest_", "_NorthEast_", "_SouthWest_",
"_SouthEast_" or if no direction is given, the default is to shade
north.
+
_SkipMapping_ tells fvwm not to switch to the desk the window is on
when it gets mapped initially (useful with _StartsOnDesk_ or
_StartsOnPage_).
+
_KeepWindowGroupsOnDesk_ makes new windows that have the window group
hint set appear on the same desk as the other windows of the same
group. Since this behavior may be confusing, the default setting is
_ScatterWindowGroups_. The window group hint is ignored when placing
windows in this case.

*Transient windows*::
	_DecorateTransient_ causes transient windows, which are normally left
	undecorated, to be given the usual fvwm decorations (title bar,
	buttons, etc.). Note that some pop-up windows, such as the xterm
	menus, are not managed by the window manager and still do not receive
	decorations. _NakedTransient_ (the default) causes transient windows
	not to be given the standard decorations. You can only bind keys or
	mouse buttons to the sides and the client part of an undecorated
	window ('S' and ´W' contexts in bindings, see *Mouse* and _Key_
	commands).
+
A window with the _RaiseTransient_ style that has transient windows
raises all its transients when it is raised. The _DontRaiseTransient_
style disables this behavior. All windows are then treated as if they
had no transients.
+
A window with the _LowerTransient_ style that has transient windows
lowers all its transients when it is lowered. The _DontLowerTransient_
style disables this behavior. All windows are then treated as if they
had no transients.
+
The _StackTransientParent_ style augments _RaiseTransient_ and
_LowerTransient_ styles. Raising a window with _StackTransientParent_
style transfers the raise action to the main window if the window
being raised is a transient and its main window has _RaiseTransient_
style; this effect makes raise on a transient act just like raise on
its main - the whole group is raised. Similar behavior holds for
lowering a whole group of transients when the main has
_LowerTransient_ style. _DontStackTransientParent_ turns this behavior
off. _(Dont)StackTransientParent_ has no effect if _RaiseTransient_
and _LowerTransient_ are not used.
+
A reasonable emulation of Motif raise/lower on transients is possible
like this
+

....
Style * RaiseTransient
Style * LowerTransient
Style * StackTransientParent
....

*Extended Window Manager Hints styles*::
	To understand the used terminology in this sub section, please read
	the *Extended Window Manager Hints* section.
+
_EWMHDonateIcon_ instructs fvwm to set the application ewmh icon hint
with the icon that is used by fvwm if the application does not provide
such hint (and if the icon used by fvwm is not an icon window).
_EWMHDonateMiniIcon_ does the same thing for mini icons. This allows
compliant pager, taskbar, iconbox ...etc to display the same (mini)
icons as fvwm. Note that on some hardware (e.g., 8-bit displays) these
styles can slow down window mapping and that in general only one of
these styles is needed by a compliant application.
_EWMHDontDonateIcon_ and _EWMHDontDonateMiniIcon_ restore the defaults
which are to not set any ewmh (mini) icons hints.
+
By default, if an application provides an ewmh icon hint of small size
(i.e., height and width less than or equal to 22), then fvwm uses this
icon as its mini icon. _EWMHMiniIconOverride_ instructs fvwm to ignore
ewmh icons and to use the mini icon provided by the _MiniIcon_ style.
_EWMHNoMiniIconOverride_ restores the default.
+
_EWMHUseStackingOrderHints_ causes fvwm to use EWMH hints and respect
EWMH hints which change the window layer.
_EWMHIgnoreStackingOrderHints_ causes fvwm to ignore EWMH layer hints.
+
An application can ask for some reserved space on the desktop by a
hint. In the EWMH terminology such a hint is called a strut and it is
used to compute the working area and may be used for window placement
and in the maximize command. _EWMHIgnoreStrutHints_ causes fvwm to
ignore such hints, as _EWMHUseStrutHints_, causes fvwm to use it which
is the default.
+
_EWMHIgnoreStateHints_ causes fvwm to ignore initial EWMH state hints
when a new window is mapped. The default _EWMHUseStateHints_ causes
fvwm to accept such hints.
+
_EWMHIgnoreWindowType_ causes fvwm to ignore EWMH window type
specification. The default _!EWMHIgnoreWindowType_ causes fvwm to
style windows of specified types as such.
+
_EWMHMaximizeIgnoreWorkingArea_ causes fvwm to ignore the EWMH working
area when it executes a *Maximize* command. With
_EWMHMaximizeUseWorkingArea_ the EWMH working area is used as with
_EWMHMaximizeUseDynamicWorkingArea_ the EWMH dynamic working area is
used (the default).
+
_EWMHPlacementIgnoreWorkingArea_ causes fvwm to ignore the EWMH
working area when it places (or places again) a window. With
_EWMHPlacementUseWorkingArea_ the EWMH working area is taken in
account as with _EWMHPlacementUseDynamicWorkingArea_ the EWMH dynamic
working area is taken in account (the default). Note that with the
_MinOverlapPlacement_ and _MinOverlapPercentPlacement_ placement
policy, the way the EWMH (dynamic) working area is taken in account is
configurable with the _MinOverlapPlacementPenalties_ style.

*Miscellaneous*::
	The _BackingStore_, _BackingStoreOff_ and _BackingStoreWindowDefault_
	determine if the X server uses backing store for the window or not.
	_BackingStore_ means that the X server tries to keep the obscured
	parts of a window in memory. This is usually slower if the client runs
	on the same machine as the X server, but can be much faster if the
	connection is slow (see also _SaveUnder_ below). _BackingStoreOff_
	disables backing store for the window. By default, fvwm does not
	enable or disable backing store itself but leaves is as the window
	requested it. To revert back to the application's choice, use the
	_BackingStoreWindowDefault_ style.
+
Note: This style is useless if the X server does not allow backing
store.
+
_SaveUnder_ enables the corresponding window attribute in the X
server. For a window using this style, the X server tries to store the
graphics below it in memory which is usually slower if the client runs
on the same machine as the X server. _SaveUnder_ may speed up fvwm if
the connection to the X server is slow (e.g. over a modem link). To
disable save under, use the _SaveUnderOff_ style. This is the default.
See also _BackingStore_ above.
+
Note: This style is useless if the X server does not allow save under.
+
_ParentalRelativity_ enables clients that use a background pixmap of
type _ParentRelative_ to achieve transparency. Fvwm modules that
support transparent colorsets require this setting. _Opacity_ is the
default and should be used for all non-transparent clients for better
performance.
+
_MwmDecor_ makes fvwm attempt to recognize and respect the mwm
decoration hints that applications occasionally use. To switch this
style off, use the _NoDecorHint_ style.
+
_MwmFunctions_ makes fvwm attempt to recognize and respect the mwm
prohibited operations hints that applications occasionally use.
_HintOverride_ makes fvwm shade out operations that mwm would
prohibit, but it lets you perform the operation anyway. _NoFuncHint_
allows turns off the mwm hints completely.
+
_OLDecor_ makes fvwm attempt to recognize and respect the olwm and
olvwm hints that many older XView and OLIT applications use. Switch
this option off with _NoOLDecor_.
+
_UseDecor_ This style is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
There are plans to replace it with a more flexible solution in
fvwm-3.0.
+
_UseDecor_ accepts one argument: the name of a decor created with
*AddToDecor*. If no decor name is specified, the "Default" decor is
used. Windows do not actually contain decors, but are always assigned
to one. If the decor is later modified with *AddToDecor*, the changes
are visible for all windows which are assigned to it. The decor for a
window can be reassigned with *ChangeDecor*.
+
_UseStyle_ This style is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
There are plans to replace it with a more flexible solution in
fvwm-3.0.
+
_UseStyle_ takes one arg, which is the name of another style. That way
you can have unrelated window names easily inherit similar traits
without retyping. For example:
+

....
Style rxvt UseStyle XTerm
....

+
Warning: If a style is built from one or more parent styles and the
parent styles are changed, the derived style is not modified. To
achieve this you have to issue the _UseStyle_ line again.
+
_Unmanaged_ Windows with the _Unmanaged_ style option are ignored by
fvwm. They are not decorated, can not be moved or resized, etc. You
probably want to use *Bugopts RaiseOverUnmanaged* too. This option can
be turned off with the _!Unmanaged_ style.
+
_State_ sets the initial value of one of the 32 user defined states
which are associated with each window. The state number ranges from 0
to 31 and must be given as an argument. The states have no meaning in
fvwm, but they can be checked in conditional commands like *Next* with
the _State_ condition and manipulated with the *State* command.
+

....
# turn on state 11 for xterms ...
Style xterm State 11
# ... but not for rxvts.
Style rxvt !State 11
....

+
Windows with the _WindowListSkip_ styles do not appear in the menu
that is created with the *WindowList* command or the lists shown in
modules like *FvwmIconMan*. In the modules, the style can usually be
ignored with an option. Please refer to the man page of the module in
question for further information. To disable this feature, use the
default style _WindowListHit_.
+
The styles _CirculateSkip_ and _CirculateHit_ control whether the
window is considered by conditional commands, for example *Next*,
_Prev_ or _All_. Windows with _CirculateSkip_, are never selected by
conditional commands. However, the styles can be overridden explicitly
in the condition with the _CirculateHit_, _CirculateHitIcon_ or
_CirculateHitShaded_ conditions, and some conditional commands,
e.g. *Current* and _All_, do this by default. The styles
_CirculateSkipIcon_, _CirculateHitIcon_, _CirculateSkipShaded_ and
_CirculateHitShaded_ work like _CirculateSkip_ and _CirculateHit_ but
apply only to iconic or shaded windows. Note: if multiple ...Skip...
options are combined, windows are only selected if they match none of
the given conditions. So, with
+

....
Style * CirculateSkipIcon, CirculateSkipShaded
....

+
only windows that are neither iconic nor shaded are selected. Note:
For historical reasons, the conditional commands understand the names
of these styles as condition names. Take care not to confuse them.

*Examples*::
+
....
# Change default fvwm behavior to no title-
# bars on windows! Also define a default icon.

Style *       !Title,                      \

+
Note that all properties for a window are or'ed together. In the above
example "FvwmPager" gets the property _StaysOnTop_ via an exact window
name match but also gets _!Handles_, _Sticky_ and _WindowListSkip_ by
a match to "Fvwm*". It gets _!Title_ by virtue of a match to "*". If
conflicting styles are specified for a window, then the last style
specified is used.

*WindowStyle* _options_::
	sets attributes (styles) on the selected window. The _options_ are
	exactly the same as for the *Style* command.

=== Window Styles

*AddButtonStyle* button [_state_] [_style_] [-- +++[!]+++_flag_ ...]::
	Adds a button style to _button_. _button_ can be a button number, or
	one of "_All_", "_Left_" or "_Right_". _state_ can be "_ActiveUp_",
	"_ActiveDown_", "_InactiveUp_" or "_InactiveDown_", or "_Active_" (the
	same as both "ActiveUp" and "ActiveDown") or "_Inactive_" (the same as
	both "InactiveUp" and "InactiveDown") or any of these 6 with
	"_Toggled_" prepended. The "Active" states apply to the focused
	window, the "Inactive" ones apply to all other windows. The "Up"
	states apply to the non pressed buttons, the "Down" ones apply to
	pressed buttons. The "Toggled" prefix refers to maximized, shaded or
	sticky windows that have the corresponding _MwmDecor..._ button style
	set. Additionally, the following shortcuts may be used: "_AllNormal_",
	"_AllToggled_", "_AllActive_", "_AllInactive_", "_AllUp_",
	"_AllDown_". They are actually different masks for 4 individual states
	from 8 total. These are supported too: "_AllActiveUp_",
	"_AllActiveDown_", "_AllInactiveUp_", "_AllInactiveDown_".
+
If _state_ is omitted, then the style is added to every state. If the
_style_ and _flags_ are enclosed in parentheses, then multiple _state_
definitions can be placed on a single line. _Flags_ for additional
button styles cannot be changed after definition.
+
Buttons are drawn in the order of definition, beginning with the most
recent button style, followed by those added with *AddButtonStyle*. To
clear the button style stack, change style flags, or for descriptions
of available styles and flags, see the *ButtonStyle* command.
+
Examples:
+

....
**ButtonStyle** 1 Pixmap led.xpm -- Top Left
**ButtonStyle** 1 ActiveDown HGradient 8 grey black
**ButtonStyle All** --  UseTitleStyle
AddButtonStyle 1 \
	ActiveUp (Pixmap a.xpm) \
	ActiveDown (Pixmap b.xpm -- Top)
AddButtonStyle 1 Vector 4 50x30@1 70x70@0 30x70@0 50x30@1
....

+
Initially for this example all button states are set to a pixmap. The
second line replaces the "ActiveDown" state with a gradient (it
overrides the pixmap assigned to it in the line before, which assigned
the same style to every state). Then, the _UseTitleStyle_ flag is set
for all buttons, which causes fvwm to draw any styles set with
*TitleStyle* before drawing the buttons. Finally, *AddButtonStyle* is
used to place additional pixmaps for both "ActiveUp" and "ActiveDown"
states and a vector button style is drawn on top of all states.

*AddTitleStyle* [_state_] [_style_] [-- +++[!]+++_flag_ ...]::
	Adds a title style to the title-bar. _state_ can be "_ActiveUp_",
	"_ActiveDown_", "_InactiveUp_" or "_InactiveDown_", or "_Active_" (the
	same as both "ActiveUp" and "ActiveDown") or "_Inactive_" (the same as
	both "InactiveUp" and "InactiveDown") or any of these 6 with "Toggled"
	prepended. If _state_ is omitted, then the style is added to every
	state. If the _style_ and _flags_ are enclosed in parentheses, then
	multiple _state_ definitions can be placed on a single line. This
	command is quite similar to the *AddButtonStyle* command.
+
Title-bars are drawn in the order of definition, beginning with the
most recent *TitleStyle*, followed by those added with
*AddTitleStyle*. To clear the title style stack, change style flags,
or for the descriptions of available styles and flags, see the
*TitleStyle* and *ButtonStyle* commands.

*AddToDecor* _decor_::
	This command is deprecated and will be removed in the future. There
	are plans to replace it with a more flexible solution in fvwm-3.0.
+
Add or divert commands to the decor named _decor_. A decor is a name
given to the set of commands which affect button styles, title-bar
styles and border styles. If _decor_ does not exist it is created;
otherwise the existing _decor_ is modified. Note: Earlier versions
allowed to use the *HilightColorset* and *WindowFont* commands in decors.
This is no longer possible. Please use the *Style* command with the
_Hilight..._ and _Font_ options.
+
New decors start out exactly like the "default" decor without any
style definitions. A given decor may be applied to a set of windows
with the _UseDecor_ option of the *Style* command. Modifying an
existing decor affects all windows which are currently assigned to it.
+
*AddToDecor* is similar in usage to the *AddToMenu* and *AddToFunc*
commands, except that menus and functions are replaced by
*ButtonStyle*, *AddButtonStyle*, *TitleStyle*, *AddTitleStyle* and
*BorderStyle* commands. Decors created with *AddToDecor* can be
manipulated with *ChangeDecor*, *DestroyDecor*, *UpdateDecor* and the
*Style* option.
+
The following example creates a decor "FlatDecor" and style
"FlatStyle". They are distinct entities:
+

....
AddToDecor FlatDecor
+ ButtonStyle All Active (-- flat) Inactive (-- flat)
+ TitleStyle  -- flat
+ BorderStyle -- HiddenHandles NoInset

Style FlatStyle \
	UseDecor FlatDecor, HandleWidth 4, Colorset 0, HilightColorset 1

Style xterm UseStyle FlatStyle
....

+
An existing window's decor may be reassigned with *ChangeDecor*. A
decor can be destroyed with *DestroyDecor*.
+

....
DestroyDecor FlatDecor
AddToDecor FlatDecor ...

Style FlatStyle UseDecor FlatDecor
....

+
and now apply the style again:
+

....
Style xterm UseStyle FlatStyle
....

*BorderStyle* _state_ [_style_] [-- +++[!]+++_flag_ ...]::
	Defines a border style for windows. _state_ can be either "_Active_"
	or "_Inactive_". If _state_ is omitted, then the style is set for both
	states. If the _style_ and _flags_ are enclosed in parentheses, then
	multiple _state_ definitions can be specified per line.
+
_style_ is a subset of the available button styles, and can only be
_TiledPixmap_ (uniform pixmaps which match the bevel colors work best
this way) or _Colorset_. If a '!' is prefixed to any _flag_, the
behavior is negated. If _style_ is not specified, then one can change
flags without resetting the style.
+
The _HiddenHandles_ flag hides the corner handle dividing lines on
windows with handles (this option has no effect for !_Handles_
windows). By default, _HiddenHandles_ is disabled.
+
The _NoInset_ flag supplements _HiddenHandles_. If given, the inner
bevel around the window frame is not drawn. If _HiddenHandles_ is not
specified, the frame looks a little strange.
+
_Raised_ causes a raised relief pattern to be drawn (default). _Sunk_
causes a sunken relief pattern to be drawn. _Flat_ inhibits the relief
pattern from being drawn.
+
To decorate the active and inactive window borders with a textured
pixmap, one might specify:
+

....
BorderStyle Active TiledPixmap marble.xpm
BorderStyle Inactive TiledPixmap granite.xpm
BorderStyle Active -- HiddenHandles NoInset
....

+
To clear the style for both states:
+

....
BorderStyle Simple
....

+
To clear for a single state:
+

....
BorderStyle Active Simple
....

+
To unset a flag for a given state:
+

....
BorderStyle Inactive -- !NoInset
....

+
title-bar buttons can inherit the border style with the
_UseBorderStyle_ flag (see *ButtonStyle*).

*ButtonState* [ActiveDown _bool_] [Inactive _bool_] [InactiveDown _bool_]::
	The *ButtonState* command controls which states of the window titles
	and title buttons are used. The default is to use all four states:
	"ActiveUp", "ActiveDown", "InactiveUp" and "InactiveDown" (see
	*ButtonStyle* and *TitleStyle* commands). The _bool_ argument after
	the key word controls if the designated state is used ("True") or not
	("False"). The _bool_ flag is the same as other commands, and not
	limited to just "True" or "False"; "Yes" and "No" may also be used.
	The "ActiveUp" state cannot be deactivated. If no arguments are
	provided or the given arguments are invalid, the default is restored.
+
If _ActiveDown_ argument is "False", no different button style for the
pressed down buttons used, instead "ActiveUp" state is used even when
button is pressed.
+
If _Inactive_ argument is "False", focused and unfocused windows look
similarly, the corresponding "Active" states are always used.
+
If _InactiveDown_ argument is "False" (only applied when _Inactive_ is
"True"), the pressed titles and title buttons in non-focused windows
are drawn using "InactiveUp" or "ActiveUp" states depending on the
values of the other key words.

*ButtonStyle* button [_state_] [_style_] [-- +++[!]+++_flag_ ...]::
	Sets the button style for a title-bar button. _button_ is the
	title-bar button number between 0 and 9, or one of "_All_", "_Left_",
	"_Right_", or "_Reset_". Button numbering is described in the *Mouse*
	command section. If the _style_ and _flags_ are enclosed in
	parentheses, then multiple _state_ definitions can be specified per
	line.
+
_state_ refers to which button state should be set. Button states are
defined as follows: "_ActiveUp_" and "_ActiveDown_" refer to the
un-pressed and pressed states for buttons on active windows; while the
"_InactiveUp_" and "_InactiveDown_" states denote buttons on inactive
windows. The shortcut "_Active_" denotes both "ActiveUp" and
"ActiveDown" states. Shortcut "_Inactive_" denotes both "InactiveUp"
and "InactiveDown" states. The similar state names like just
described, but with the "Toggled" prefix are used instead for title
buttons which have one of the _MwmDecorMax_, _MwmDecorShade_,
_MwmDecorStick_ or _MwmDecorLayer_ hints, if the window is maximized,
shaded, sticky or placed on specific layer, respectively.
+

....
AddToDecor Default
+ ButtonStyle 6                   \
  Vector 4 50x25@1 85x75@0 15x75@0 50x25@1
+ ButtonStyle 6 ToggledActiveUp   \

  Vector 4 50x75@0 85x25@1 15x25@0 50x75@0
+ ButtonStyle 6 - MwmDecorShade
Mouse 0 6 N WindowShade
....

+
Additionally, the following shortcuts may be used: "_AllNormal_",
"_AllToggled_", "_AllActive_", "_AllInactive_", "_AllUp_",
"_AllDown_". They are actually different masks for 4 individual states
from 8 total. These are supported too: "_AllActiveUp_",
"_AllActiveDown_", "_AllInactiveUp_", "_AllInactiveDown_".
+
If _state_ is specified, that particular button state is set. If
_state_ is omitted, every state is set. Specifying a style destroys
the current style (use *AddButtonStyle* to avoid this).
+
If _style_ is omitted, then state-dependent flags can be set for the
primary button style without destroying the current style. Examples
(each line should be considered independent):
+

....
ButtonStyle Left -- flat
ButtonStyle All ActiveUp (-- flat) Inactive (-- flat)
....

+
The first line sets every state of the left buttons to flat, while the
second sets only the "ActiveUp" and "Inactive" states of every button
to flat (only flags are changed; the buttons' individual styles are
not changed).
+
If you want to reset all buttons to their defaults:
+

....
ButtonStyle Reset
....

+
To reset the "ActiveUp" button state of button 1 to the default:
+

....
ButtonStyle 1 ActiveUp Default
....

+
To reset all button states of button 1 to the default of button number
2:
+

....
ButtonStyle 1 Default 2
....

+
For any button, multiple _state_ definitions can be given on one line
by enclosing the _style_ and _flags_ in parentheses. If only one
definition per line is given the parentheses can be omitted.
+
_flags_ affect the specified _state_. If a '!' is prefixed to any
_flag_, its behavior is negated. The available state-dependent flags
for all styles are described here (the *ButtonStyle* entry deals with
state-independent flags).
+
_Raised_ causes a raised relief pattern to be drawn.
+
_Sunk_ causes a sunken relief pattern to be drawn.
+
_Flat_ inhibits the relief pattern from being drawn.
+
_UseTitleStyle_ causes the given button state to render the current
title style before rendering the buttons' own styles. The _Raised_,
_Flat_ and _Sunk_ *TitleStyle* flags are ignored since they are
redundant in this context.
+
_UseBorderStyle_ causes the button to inherit the decorated
*BorderStyle* options.
+
_Raised_, _Sunk_ and _Flat_ are mutually exclusive, and can be
specified for the initial *ButtonStyle* only. _UseTitleStyle_ and
_UseBorderStyle_ are also mutually exclusive (both can be off
however). The default is _Raised_ with both _UseBorderStyle and
UseTitleStyle_ left unset.
+
*Important*
+
for the "ActiveDown" and "InactiveDown" states: When a button is
pressed, the relief is inverted. Because of this, to obtain the raised
look in "ActiveDown" or "InactiveDown" states you must specify the
opposite of the desired relief (i.e. _Sunk_ for "ActiveDown" or
"InactiveDown"). This behavior is consistent, but may seem confusing
at first. The same applies to the "Toggled" states.
+
Button styles are classified as non-destructive, partially
destructive, or fully destructive. Non-destructive styles do not
affect the image. Partially destructive styles can obscure some or all
parts of the underlying image (i.e. _Pixmap_). Fully destructive
styles obscure the entire underlying image (i.e. _Solid_ or one of the
_gradient_ styles). Thus, if stacking styles with *AddButtonStyle* (or
*AddTitleStyle* for title-bars), use care in sequencing styles to
minimize redraw.
+
The available styles are:
+
_Simple_, _Default_, _Solid_, _Colorset_, _Vector_, _?Gradient_,
_Pixmap_, _AdjustedPixmap_, _ShrunkPixmap_, _StretchedPixmap_,
_TiledPixmap_, _MiniIcon_
+
The description of these styles and their arguments follow:
+
The _Simple_ style does nothing. There are no arguments, and this
style is an example of a non-destructive button style.
+
The _Default_ style conditionally accepts one argument: a number which
specifies the default button number to load. If the style command
given is *ButtonStyle* or *AddButtonStyle*, the argument is optional
(if given, it overrides the current button). If a command other than
*ButtonStyle* or *AddButtonStyle* is used, the number must be
specified.
+
The _Solid_ style fills the button with a solid color. The relief
border color is not affected. The color is specified as a single
argument. This style is fully destructive.
+
The _Colorset_ _cs_ [_alpha_] style fills the button with the Colorset
_cs_. The optional _alpha_ argument is a percentage between 0 and 100.
It causes fvwm to merge the colorset background onto the button using
this percentage. If the percentage is 0 the colorset background is
hidden and if it is 100 the colorset background is fully applied. The
default is 100. So, the destructiveness depends on the _alpha_
argument.
+
The _Vector_ _num_
__X__**[**__offset__**p]x**__Y__**[**__offset__**p]@C ...**
style draws a line pattern. Since this is a standard button style, the
keyword _Vector_ is optional, _num_ is a number of point
specifications of the form
__X__**[**__offset__**p]x**__Y__**[**__offset__**p]@C ...** _X_
and _Y_ are point coordinates inside the button, given in percents
(from 0 to 100). An optional absolute _offset_ in pixels, can be given
as "+<offset>p" for a positive or "-<offset>p" for a negative offset.
+
_C_ specifies a line color (0 - the shadow color, 1 - the highlight
color, 2 - the background color, 3 - the foreground color, 4 - only
move the point, do not draw). The first point color is not used. You
can use up to 10000 points in a line pattern. This style is partially
destructive.
+
The specification is a little cumbersome:
+

....
ButtonStyle 2 Vector 4 50x30@1 70x70@0 30x70@0 50x30@1
....

+
then the button 2 decoration uses a 4-point pattern consisting of a
line from (x=50,y=30) to (70,70) in the shadow color (@0), and then to
(30,70) in the shadow color, and finally to (50,30) in the highlight
color (@1). Is that too confusing? See the fvwm web pages for some
examples with screenshots.
+
A more complex example of _Vector_:
+

....
ButtonStyle 8 Vector 10 45x65@2 45x75@3 \
20x75@3 20x50@3 35x50@3 35x65@1 35x25@1 \
75x25@1 75x65@0 35x65@0
ButtonStyle 0 Vector 10 45x65@2 45x75@0 \
20x75@0 20x50@1 45x50@1 45x65@0 75x65@3 \
75x25@3 35x25@3 35x47@3
....

+
The _Gradient_ styles denote color gradients. Fill in the question
mark with any one of the defined gradient types. Please refer to the
*Color Gradients* section for a description of the gradient syntax.
The gradient styles are fully destructive.
+
The _Pixmap_ style displays a pixmap. A pixmap should be specified as
an argument. For example, the following would give button number 2 the
same pixmap for all 4 states (2 active and 2 inactive), and button
number 4 all different pixmaps.
+

....
ButtonStyle 2 Pixmap my_pixmap.xpm
ButtonStyle 4 \
ActiveUp (Pixmap activeup.xpm) \
ActiveDown (Pixmap activedown.xpm) \
Inactive (Pixmap inactiveup.xpm)
ButtonStyle 4 \
InactiveDown Pixmap inactivedown.xpm
....

+
The pixmap specification can be given as an absolute or relative
pathname (see *ImagePath*). If the pixmap cannot be found, the button
style reverts to _Simple_. Flags specific to the _Pixmap_ style are
_Left_, _Right_, _Top_, and _Bottom_. These can be used to justify the
pixmap (default is centered for both directions). Pixmap transparency
is used for the color "None." This style is partially destructive.
+
The _AdjustedPixmap_ style is similar to the _Pixmap_ style. But the
image is resized to exactly fit the button.
+
The _ShrunkPixmap_ style is similar to the _Pixmap_ style. But if the
image is bigger than the button the image is resized to fit into the
button.
+
The _StretchedPixmap_ style is similar to the _Pixmap_ style. But if
the image is smaller than the button the image is resized to cover the
button.
+
The _TiledPixmap_ style accepts a pixmap to be tiled as the button
background. One pixmap is specified as an argument. Pixmap
transparency is not used. This style is fully destructive.
+
The _MiniIcon_ style draws the window's miniature icon in the button,
which is specified with the _MiniIcon_ option of the *Style* command.
This button style accepts no arguments. Example:
+

....
Style *     MiniIcon mini-bx2.xpm
Style xterm MiniIcon mini-term.xpm
Style Emacs MiniIcon mini-doc.xpm

ButtonStyle 1 MiniIcon
....

*ButtonStyle* _button_ - +++[!]+++_flag_ ...::
	Sets state-independent flags for the specified _button_.
	State-independent flags affect button behavior. Each _flag_ is
	separated by a space. If a '!' is prefixed to the flag then the
	behavior is negated. The special flag _Clear_ clears any existing
	flags.
+
The following flags are usually used to tell fvwm which buttons should
be affected by mwm function hints (see _MwmFunctions_ option of the
*Style* command. This is not done automatically since you might have
buttons bound to complex functions, for instance.
+
_MwmDecorMenu_ should be assigned to title-bar buttons which display a
menu. The default assignment is the leftmost button. When a window
with the _MwmFunctions_ *Style* option requests not to show this
button, it is hidden.
+
_MwmDecorMin_ should be assigned to title-bar buttons which minimize
or iconify the window. The default assignment is the second button
over from the rightmost button. When a window with the _MwmFunctions_
*Style* option requests not to show this button, it is hidden.
+
_MwmDecorMax_ should be assigned to title-bar buttons which maximize
the window. The default assignment is the rightmost button. When a
window with the _MwmFunctions_ *Style* option requests not to show
this button, it is hidden. When the window is maximized, the vector
pattern on the button looks pressed in.
+
_MwmDecorShade_ should be assigned to title-bar buttons which shade
the window (see *WindowShade* command). When the window is shaded, the
vector pattern on the button looks pressed in.
+
_MwmDecorStick_ should be assigned to title-bar buttons which make the
window sticky. When the window is sticky, the vector pattern on the
button looks pressed in.
+
The flag _MwmDecorLayer_ _layer_ should be assigned to title-bar
buttons which place the window in the layer numbered _layer_. When the
window is on that specific layer, the vector pattern on the button
looks pressed in.

*ChangeDecor* _decor_::
	This command is deprecated and will be removed in the future. There
	are plans to replace it with a more flexible solution in fvwm-3.0.
+
Changes the decor of a window to _decor_. _decor_ is "Default" or the
name of a decor defined with *AddToDecor*. If _decor_ is invalid,
nothing occurs. If called from somewhere in a window or its border,
then that window is affected. If called from the root window the user
is allowed to select the target window. *ChangeDecor* only affects
attributes which can be set using the *AddToDecor* command.
+

....
ChangeDecor CustomDecor1
....

*DestroyDecor* [recreate] _decor_::
	This command is deprecated and will be removed in the future. There
	are plans to replace it with a more flexible solution in fvwm-3.0.
+
Deletes the _decor_ defined with *AddToDecor*, so that subsequent
references to it are no longer valid. Windows using this _decor_
revert to the "Default" decor. The optional parameter _recreate_ tells
fvwm not to throw away the decor completely but to throw away only its
contents. If the decor is created again later, windows do not use it
before the _UseDecor_ style is applied again unless the decor was
destroyed with the _recreate_ option. The decor named "Default" cannot
be destroyed.
+

....
DestroyDecor CustomDecor1
....

*TitleStyle* [_justification_] [Height [_num_]] [MinHeight [_num_]]::
	Sets attributes for the title-bar. Justifications can be _Centered_,
	_RightJustified_ or _LeftJustified_. _Height_ sets the title bar's
	height to an amount in pixels. _MinHeight_ sets the minimal height in
	pixels of the title bar. Defaults are _Centered_, the window's font
	height and no minimal height. To reset the font height to the default
	value, omit the _num_ argument after the _Height_ keyword. The
	_MinHeight_ height is reset by _Height_ or if given with no argument.
	Example:
+

....
TitleStyle LeftJustified Height 24
....

*TitleStyle* [_state_] [_style_] [-- +++[!]+++_flag_ ...]::
	Sets the style for the title-bar. See also *AddTitleStyle* and
	*ButtonStyle* _state_ can be one of "_ActiveUp_", "_ActiveDown_",
	"_InactiveUp_", or "_InactiveDown_". Shortcuts like "_Active_" and
	"_Inactive_" are allowed. The states with the "Toggled" prefix are
	allowed too, the title itself does not use "Toggled" states, but these
	states are used for the buttons with *ButtonStyle* _UseTitleStyle_. If
	_state_ is omitted, then the _style_ is added to every state. If
	parentheses are placed around the _style_ and _flags_, then multiple
	state definitions can be given per line. _style_ can be omitted so
	that flags can be set while not destroying the current style.
+
If a '!' is prefixed to any _flag_, its behavior is negated. Valid
flags for each state include _Raised_, _Flat_ and _Sunk_ (these are
mutually exclusive). The default is _Raised_. See the note in
*ButtonStyle* regarding the "_ActiveDown_" state. Examples:
+

....
TitleStyle ActiveUp HGradient 16 navy black
TitleStyle \
ActiveDown (Solid red -- flat) \
Inactive (TiledPixmap wood.xpm)
TitleStyle \
ActiveUp (-- Flat) \
ActiveDown (-- Raised) \
InactiveUp (-- Flat) \
InactiveDown (-- Sunk)
....

+
This sets the "ActiveUp" state to a horizontal gradient, the
"ActiveDown" state to solid red, and the "Inactive" states to a tiled
wood pixmap. Finally, "ActiveUp" and "InactiveUp" are set to look
flat, while "ActiveDown" set to be sunk (the _Raised_ flag for the
"ActiveDown" state causes it to appear sunk due to relief inversion),
and "InactiveDown" is set to look raised. An example which sets flags
for all states:
+

....
TitleStyle -- flat
....

+
For a flattened look:
+

....
TitleStyle -- flat
ButtonStyle All Active (-- flat) Inactive (-- flat)
....

+
*TitleStyle* accepts all the *ButtonStyle* styles and arguments:
+
_Simple_, _Default_, _Solid_, _Colorset_, _Vector_, _?Gradient_,
_Pixmap_, _AdjustedPixmap_, _ShrunkPixmap_, _StretchedPixmap_,
_TiledPixmap_, _MiniIcon_.
+
See the *ButtonStyle* command for a description of all these styles
and their arguments.
+
In addition to these styles *TitleStyle* accepts a powerful
_MultiPixmap_ option. This allows you to specify different pixmaps,
colorsets or colors for different parts of the titlebar. Some of them
are tiled or stretched to fit a particular space; others are discrete
"transition" images. The definable _sections_ are:
+
--
_Main_:::
	The full titlebar
+
_LeftMain_:::
	Left of title text
+
_RightMain_:::
	Right of title text
+
_UnderText_:::
	Underneath title text
+
_LeftOfText_:::
	just to the left of the title text
+
_RightOfText_:::
	just to the right of the title text
+
_LeftEnd_:::
	at the far left end of the titlebar (just after left buttons if any)
+
_RightEnd_:::
	at the far right end of the titlebar (just before right buttons if any)
+
_Buttons_:::
	under buttons in case of _UseTitleStyle_
+
_LeftButtons_:::
	under left buttons in case of _UseTitleStyle_
+
_RightButtons_:::
	under right buttons in case of _UseTitleStyle_
--
+
None of these are mandatory except for _Main_ (or, if you do not
define _Main_ you must define both _LeftMain_ and _RightMain_). If no
_Buttons_ pixmaps are defined and _UseTitleStyle_ is specified for one
or more buttons, _Main_, _LeftMain_ or _RightMain_ are used as
appropriate.
+
The syntax for this style type is:
+
....
MultiPixmap section style arg, ...
....
+
continuing for whatever you want to define. The _style_ can be either
_TiledPixmap_, _AdjustedPixmap_, _Colorset_ or _Solid_. See the
*ButtonStyle* command for the description of these styles. In the case
of a transition section, _LeftEnd_, _LeftOfText_, _RightOfText_ or
_RightEnd_, _AdjustedPixmap_ only resize the pixmap in the "y"
direction. For the _Colorset_ and _Solid_ styles a width of the half
of the title bar height is assumed for the transition sections.
+
An example:
+
....
MultiPixmap Main AdjustedPixmap foo.xpm, \
      UnderText TiledPixmap bar.xpm, \
      Buttons Colorset 2
....
+
Note that the old syntax is still supported: if the style is omitted,
_TiledPixmap_ is assumed and adding "(stretched)" between the section
and the file name implies _AdjustedPixmap_.
*UpdateDecor* [_decor_]::
This command is deprecated and will be removed in the future. There
are plans to replace it with a more flexible solution in fvwm-3.0.
+
This command is kept mainly for backward compatibility. Since all
elements of a decor are updated immediately when they are changed,
this command is mostly useless.
+
Updates window decorations. _decor_ is an optional argument which
specifies the _decor_ to update. If given, only windows which are
assigned to that particular _decor_ are updated. This command is
useful, for instance, after a *ButtonStyle*, *TitleStyle* or
*BorderStyle* (possibly used in conjunction with *AddToDecor*).
Specifying an invalid decor results in all windows being updated.
// END 'styles'
endif::[]

=== Controlling the Virtual Desktop

*Desk* _arg1_ [_arg2_] [_min_ _max_]::
	This command has been renamed. Please see *GotoDesk* command.

*DesktopName* _desk_ _name_::
	Defines the name of the desktop number _desk_ to _name_. This name is
	used in the *WindowList* command and in the *FvwmPager* where it
	override the _Label_ configuration option. Moreover, if consecutive
	names starting from desktop 0 are defined, then these names can be
	used by any EWMH compliant application (as a pager).

*DesktopConfiguration* global | per-monitor | shared::
	This command controls the behaviour of how desktops should be managed
	by FVWM. By default, for all screens detected by FVWM through RandR
	support, the option of global means that all windows on the same desk
	across monitors is treated as one -- hence, when a change of
	desktop/page happens, the same change occurs across all monitors.
+
With per-monitor , each RandR monitor has a separate copy of desktops,
and hence function independently of one another when switching
desks/pages.
+
When __shared__ is set, the desktops are shared amongst all monitors.  So for
example, with the following number of desktops defined with two monitors
(__[]__ is monitor1, and __<>__ is monitor2):
+
....
[0]     1      2      <3>     4
....
+

Moving between desktops would still honor the monitor the desktop is being
requested on.  If __monitor1__ wanted to switch to desktop 3, then that
desktop is exchanged with __monitor2__ such that the following showed the
active desktop on both monitors:
+
....
<0>     1      2      [3]     4
....
+
This concept is similar to how spectrwm or xmonad handles desktops.
+
**Note:** these each *DesktopConfiguration* mode can be changed on-the-fly.

*DesktopSize* __Horizontal__x__Vertical__::
	Defines the virtual desktop size in units of the physical screen size.

*EdgeResistance* __delay__::
+
**EdgeResistance** _scrolling_ _moving_ [_screen-scrolling_]::
	Tells how hard it should be to change the desktop viewport by moving
	the mouse over the edge of the screen. The parameter tells how many
	milliseconds the pointer must spend on the screen edge before fvwm
	moves the viewport. This is intended for people who use
+

....
EdgeScroll 100 100
....

+
but find themselves accidentally flipping pages when they do not want
to. If -1 is given as the delay, scrolling is disabled completely.
+
The second form of invocation with two or three arguments is obsolete
and should be replaced with the following three commands as needed:
+

....
EdgeResistance scrolling
Style * EdgeMoveDelay scrolling
Style * EdgeMoveResistance moving
or
Style * EdgeMoveResistance moving screen-scrolling
....

+
Fvwm does this substitution automatically and prints a warning.

*EdgeScroll* [_screen RANDRNAME_] _horizontal_[p] _vertical_[p] [wrap | wrapx | wrapy]::
	Specifies the percentage of a page to scroll when the cursor hits the
	edge of a page.
	The optional '_screen RANDRNAME_' specifies the RandR monitor which
	this setting should apply to, ignoring all other monitors.  Without
	this option, it applies the value to all monitors.
	A trailing '_p_' changes the interpretation to mean
	pixels. If you do not want any paging or scrolling when you hit the
	edge of a page include
+

....
EdgeScroll 0 0
....

+
in your _config_ file, or possibly better, set the *EdgeThickness* to
zero. See the *EdgeThickness* command. If you want whole pages, use
+

....
EdgeScroll 100 100
....

+
Both _horizontal_ and _vertical_ should be positive numbers.
+
If the _horizontal_ and _vertical_ percentages are multiplied by 1000
or one of the keywords _wrap_, _wrapx_ and _wrapy_ is given then
scrolling wraps around at the edge of the desktop. If
+

....
EdgeScroll 100000 100000
....

+
is used fvwm scrolls by whole pages, wrapping around at the edge of
the desktop.

*EdgeThickness* [_screen RANDRNAME_] 0 | 1 | 2::
	This is the width or height of the invisible window that fvwm creates
	on the edges of the screen that are used for the edge scrolling
	feature.
+
The optional '_screen RANDRNAME_' specifies the RandR monitor which
this setting should apply to, ignoring all other monitors.  Without
this option, it applies the value to all monitors.
+
In order to enable page scrolling via the mouse, four windows called
the "pan frames" are placed at the very edge of the screen. This is
how fvwm detects the mouse's presence at the window edge. Because of
the way this works, they need to be at the top of the stack and eat
mouse events, so if you have any kind of error along the lines of:
"mouse clicks at the edge of the screen do the wrong thing" you're
having trouble with the pan frames and (assuming you do not use the
mouse to flip between pages) should set the EdgeThickness to 0.
+
A value of 0 completely disables mouse edge scrolling, even while
dragging a window. 1 gives the smallest pan frames, which seem to work
best except on some servers.
+
2 is the default.
+
Pan frames of 1 or 2 pixels can sometimes be confusing, for example,
if you drag a window over the edge of the screen, so that it straddles
a pan frame, clicks on the window, near the edge of the screen are
treated as clicks on the root window.

*EwmhBaseStruts* _screen RANDRNAME_ _left_ _right_ _top_ _bottom_::
	Where left, right, top and bottom are positive or null integers which
	define bands at the edge of the screen. If _screen_ is given, followed
	by the RANDRNAME of a given display, then the EwmhBaseStruts are
	defined for just RANDRNAME. _left_ defines a band on the left of your
	screen of width _left_, _right_ defines a band on the right of your
	screen of width _right_, _top_ defines a band on the top of your
	screen of height _top_ and _bottom_ defines a band on the bottom of
	your screen of height _bottom_. The unit is the pixel and the default
	is 0 0 0 0. These areas define additional reserved space to the
	reserved space defined by some ewmh compliant applications. This is
	used to compute the Working Area. See the *Extended Window Manager
	Hints* section for a definition of the Working Area.

*EwmhNumberOfDesktops* _num_ [_max_]::
	This command is useful only for an ewmh compliant pager or taskbar (as
	kpager or kicker taskbar) and not for fvwm modules ( *FvwmPager* or
	*FvwmIconMan*). It causes a compliant application to consider at least
	_num_ desktops (desktop 0 to desktop _num_-1). The optional argument
	_max_ causes a compliant application to never consider more than _max_
	desktops. If _max_ is 0 (the default) there is no limitation. The
	actual number of desktops is determined dynamically. It is at least
	_num_, but it can be d if there is a window on desktop d-1 (or if the
	current desktop is desktop d-1) and d is less or equal to _max_ or
	_max_ is null. Moreover, a compliant pager can ask to change _num_
	itself. This is accepted by fvwm only if this number is less than or
	equal to _max_ or if _max_ is null. Note that negative desktops are
	not supported by the ewmh specification. The default is 4 0.

*GotoDesk* [prev | _arg1_ [_arg2_] [_min_ _max_]]::
	Switches the current viewport to another desktop (workspace, room).
+
The command takes 1, 2, 3, or 4 arguments. A single argument is
interpreted as a relative desk number. Two arguments are understood as
a relative and an absolute desk number. Three arguments specify a
relative desk and the minimum and maximum of the allowable range. Four
arguments specify the relative, absolute, minimum and maximum values.
(Desktop numbers can be negative). If a literal _prev_ is given as the
single argument, the last visited desk number is used.
+
If _arg1_ is non zero then the next desktop number is the current
desktop number plus _arg1_.
+
If _arg1_ is zero then the new desktop number is _arg2_. (If _arg2_ is
not present, then the command has no effect.)
+
If _min_ and _max_ are given, the new desktop number is no smaller
than _min_ and no bigger than _max_. Values out of this range are
truncated (if you gave an absolute desk number) or wrapped around (if
you gave a relative desk number).
+
The syntax is the same as for *MoveToDesk*, which moves a window to a
different desktop.
+
The number of active desktops is determined dynamically. Only desktops
which contain windows or are currently being displayed are active.
Desktop numbers must be between 2147483647 and -2147483648 (is that
enough?).

*GotoDeskAndPage* screen | prev | _desk_ _xpage_ _ypage_::
	Switches the current viewport to another desktop and page, similar to
	the *GotoDesk* and *GotoPage* commands. The new desk is _desk_ and the
	new page is (_xpage_,_ypage_).

*GotoPage* screen | prev | [_options_] _x_[p] _y_[p]::
	Moves the desktop viewport to page (x,y). The upper left page is
	(0,0), the upper right is (M,0), where M is one less than the current
	number of horizontal pages specified in the *DesktopSize* command. The
	lower left page is (0,N), and the lower right page is (M,N), where N
	is the desktop's vertical size as specified in the *DesktopSize*
	command. To switch to a page relative to the current one add a
	trailing '_p_' after any or both numerical arguments.
+
Possible _options_ are _wrapx_ and _wrapy_ to wrap around the x or y
coordinate when the viewport is moved beyond the border of the
desktop.
+
The name of the RandR screen.
+
To go to the last visited page use _prev_ as the first argument. The
*GotoPage* function should not be used in a pop-up menu.
+
Examples:
+

....
# Go to page (2,3)
GotoPage 2 3

# Go to lowest and rightmost page
GotoPage -1 -1

# Go to last page visited
GotoPage prev

# Go two pages to the right and one page up
GotoPage +2p -1p
....

*Scroll* [screen RANDRNAME] [_horizonal_[p] _vertical_[p] | reverse]::
	Scrolls the virtual desktop's viewport by _horizontal_ pages in the
	x-direction and _vertical_ pages in the y-direction or starts
	interactive scrolling of the viewport. Either or both entries may be
	negative. Both _horizontal_ and _vertical_ values are expressed in
	percent of pages, so
+

....
Scroll 100 100
....

+
means to scroll down and right by one full page.
+

....
Scroll 50 25
....

+
means to scroll right half a page and down a quarter of a page. The
*Scroll* function should not be called from pop-up menus. Normally,
scrolling stops at the edge of the desktop.
+
If the _horizontal_ and _vertical_ percentages are 100 or more and are
multiplied by 1000 then scrolling wraps around at the edge of the
desktop. If
+

....
Scroll 100000 0
....

+
is executed over and over fvwm moves to the next desktop page on each
execution and wraps around at the edge of the desktop, so that every
page is hit in turn.
+
If the letter '_p_' is appended to each coordinate (_horizontal_
and/or _vertical_), then the scroll amount is measured in pixels.
+
Without arguments or if the option _reverse_ is given interactive
scrolling takes place. The viewport scrolls as the mouse is moved.
With the _reverse_ option scrolling is done in opposite direction of
the mouse movement, and without it scrolling in the same direction as
the mouse.
+
The binding
+

....
Mouse 1 A CM Scroll reverse
....

+
gives an effect of grabbing and dragging the viewport with button 1 if Control
and Meta is pressed.
+
If _screen_ is given, followed by the RANDRNAME of a given display, then
the specified screen is scrolled. This is only useful if using per-monitor
or shared _DesktopConfiguration_ and wanting to scroll a monitor other than
the current monitor. Interactive scrolling always scrolls the current monitor.

=== User Functions and Shell Commands

*AddToFunc* [_name_ [I | J | M | C | H | D _action_]]::
	Begins or adds to a function definition. Here is an example:
+

....
AddToFunc Move-or-Raise I Raise
 + M Move
 + D Lower
....

+
The function name is "Move-or-Raise", and it could be invoked from a
menu or a mouse binding or key binding:
+

....
Mouse 1 TS A Move-or-Raise
....

+
The _name_ must not contain embedded whitespace. No guarantees are
made whether function names with embedded whitespace work or not. This
behavior may also change in the future without further notice. The
letter before the _action_ tells what kind of action triggers the
command which follows it. '_I_' stands for "Immediate", and is
executed as soon as the function is invoked. '_J_' is similar to
"Immediate" but is delayed until a button is pressed or released or
the pointer is moved, or the function completes. It is always executed
before the other function actions. '_M_' stands for "Motion", i.e. if
the user starts moving the mouse. '_C_' stands for "Click", i.e., if
the user presses and releases the mouse button. '_H_' stands for
"Hold", i.e. if the user presses a mouse button and holds it down for
more than *ClickTime* milliseconds. '_D_' stands for "Double-click".
The action '_I_' causes an action to be performed on the button-press,
if the function is invoked with prior knowledge of which window to act
on.
+
There is a number of predefined symbols that are replaced by certain
values if they appear on the command line. Please refer to the
*Command Expansion* section for details.
+
*Warning* Please read the comments on executing complex functions in
the section *Scripting and Complex Functions*.
+
Examples:
+
If you call
+

....
Key F10 R A Function MailFunction xmh "-font fixed"
....

+
and "MailFunction" is
+

....
AddToFunc MailFunction
 + I Next ($0) Iconify off
 + I Next (AcceptsFocus, $0) Focus
 + I None ($0) Exec exec $0 $1
....

+
Then the last line of the function becomes
+

....
 + I None (xmh) Exec exec xmh -font fixed
....

+
The expansion is performed as the function is executed, so you can use
the same function with all sorts of different arguments. You could use
+

....
Key F11 R A Function MailFunction zmail "-bg pink"
....

+
in the same _config_, if you wanted. An example of using "$[w.id]" is:
+

....
AddToFunc PrintFunction
 + I Raise
 + I Exec xdpr -id $[w.id]
....

+
Note that "$$" is expanded to '$'.
+
Another example: bind right mouse button within the window button
number 6 (this is a minimize button for the win95 theme) to iconify
all windows of the same resource:
+

....
AddToFunc FuncIconifySameResource "I" All ($0) Iconify on
Mouse 3 6 A FuncIconifySameResource $[w.resource]
....

*Beep*::
	As might be expected, this makes the terminal beep.

*DestroyFunc* _function_::
	Deletes a function, so that subsequent references to it are no longer
	valid. You can use this to change the contents of a function during a
	fvwm session. The function can be rebuilt using *AddToFunc*.
+

....
DestroyFunc PrintFunction
....

*Echo* _string_::
	Prints a message to the debug log file, which requires logging to be
	enabled. See the *-v* option or *PrintInfo* for more information on both
	enabling debug logging and the log file location. Potentially useful for
	debugging things in your _config_ or getting the value of variables.
+

....
Echo Beginning style definitions...
Echo Current desk $[desk.n].
....

*EchoFuncDefinition* _function_::
	The *EchoFuncDefinition* is similar to the *Echo* command but prints
	the definition for the given _function_ to the debug log file. It is
	useful to find out how fvwm handles quoting and for debugging functions.

*Exec* _command_::
	Executes _command_. You should not use an ampersand '&' at the end of
	the command. You probably want to use an additional "exec" at the
	beginning of _command_. Without that, the shell that fvwm invokes to
	run your command stays until the command exits. In effect, you'll have
	twice as many processes running as you need. Note that some shells are
	smart enough to avoid this, but it never hurts to include the "exec"
	anyway.
+
The following example binds function key
+
in the root window, with no modifiers, to the exec function. The
program rxvt is started with an assortment of options.
+

....
Key F1 R N Exec exec rxvt -fg yellow -bg blue \
-e /bin/tcsh
....

+
Note that this function doesn't wait for _command_ to complete, so
things like:
+

....
Exec "echo AddToMenu ... > /tmp/file"
Read /tmp/file
....

+
do not work reliably (see the *PipeRead* command).

*ExecUseShell* [_shell_]::
	Makes the *Exec* command use the specified shell, or the value of the
	_$SHELL_ environment variable if no shell is specified, instead of the
	default Bourne shell (_/bin/sh_).
+

....
ExecUseShell
ExecUseShell /usr/local/bin/tcsh
....

*Function* _FunctionName_::
	Used to bind a previously defined function to a key or mouse button.
	The following example binds mouse button 1 to a function called
	"Move-or-Raise", whose definition was provided as an example earlier
	in this man page. After performing this binding fvwm executes the
	"move-or-raise" function whenever button 1 is pressed in a window's
	title-bar.
+

....
Mouse 1 T A Function Move-or-Raise
....

+
The keyword *Function* may be omitted if _FunctionName_ does not
coincide with an fvwm command.
+
Warning: Please read the comments on executing complex functions in
the section *Scripting and Complex Functions*.

*InfoStoreAdd* _key_ _value_::
	Stores the _value_ at the given _key_. This is useful to store generic
	information used in the lifetime of an fvwm config file. For example
	storing program preferences for opening video files.
+
The purpose of this command is to store internal information to fvwm
which can be used bu fvwm functions, or when opening programs of a
certain type. Previous to this command the only way to do this was via
*SetEnv* but this is discouraged because it places such information in
the environment, which pollutes it and makes the information global to
other processes started by fvwm which may then modify them which might
not be what's wanted. Hence the point of *InfoStoreAdd* is to still
allow for such information to be stored, but kept internal to fvwm.
+
In this way, one can build up as many key/value pairs as needed.
Recalling the value of a given key happens through fvwm's usual
expansion mechanism. See the *Command Expansion* section for more
details. For example:
+

....
InfoStoreAdd teddybearprog xteddy

# Echo the value of teddybearprog
Echo $[infostore.teddybearprog]
....

+
Removing an entry from the InfoStore is done with the
*InfoStoreRemove* command.

*InfoStoreRemove* _key_::
	Removes an entry at the given _key_ from the InfoStore. Example:
+

....
InfoStoreRemove teddybearprog
....

*Nop*::
	Does nothing. This is used to insert a blank line or separator in a
	menu. If the menu item specification is
+

....
AddToMenu MyMenu " " Nop
....

+
then a blank line is inserted. If it looks like
+

....
+ "" Nop
....

+
then a separator line is inserted. Can also be used as the
double-click action for *Menu* or *Popup*.

*PipeRead* _command_ [quiet]::
	Causes fvwm to read commands from the output of the _command_. This
	_command_ is executed by _/bin/sh_ as if you typed it on the command
	line. If the command consists of more than one word it must be quoted.
	Useful for building up dynamic menu entries based on a directories
	contents, for example. If the keyword _Quiet_ follows the command no
	message is produced if the _command_ is not found.
+
Example:
+

....
AddToMenu HomeDirMenu
PipeRead 'for i in $HOME/*; \
do echo "+ $i Exec xterm -e vi $i"; done'
....

+
Note: The *PipeRead* changes the pointer to a watch cursor by default
during execution. However, some commands, for example xwd, need to
take control of the pointer themselves and do not work. To disable the
watch cursor, use the command prior to *PipeRead*
+

....
BusyCursor Read off
....

+
The *PipeRead* command executes synchronously. If you want to *Exec*
something, but need the command to run synchronously, you might do
something like:
+

....
PipeRead 'command 1>&2'
....

+
The redirection causes any output from the program to go to stderr
instead of being read as a sequence of commands by fvwm. *PipeRead*
returns 1 if the given command could be executed or -1 if not (see the
section *Conditional Commands* for the meaning of return codes).

*Read* _filename_ [quiet]::
	Causes fvwm to read commands from the file named _filename_. If the
	keyword _Quiet_ follows the command no message is produced if the file
	is not found. If the file name does not begin with a slash ('/'), fvwm
	looks in the user's data directory, then the system data directory.
	The user's data directory is by default _$HOME/.fvwm_. It can be
	overridden by exporting _FVWM_USERDIR_ set to any other directory. The
	*Read* command returns 1 if the given file could be read or -1 if not
	(see the section *Conditional Commands* for the meaning of return
	codes).

*SetEnv* _variable_ _value_::
	Set an environment variable to a new value, similar to the shell's
	export or setenv command. The _variable_ and its _value_ are inherited
	by processes started directly by fvwm. For example:
+

....
SetEnv height HEIGHT
....

+


*Silent* _command_::
	A number of commands require a window to operate on. If no window was
	selected when such a function is invoked the user is asked to select a
	window. Sometimes this behavior is unwanted, for example if the
	function was called by a module and the window that was selected at
	first does not exist anymore. You can prevent this by putting *Silent*
	in front of the fvwm _command_. If a function that needs a window is
	called with *Silent* without a window selected, it simply returns
	without doing anything. If *Silent* is used on a user defined function
	it affects all function and sub function calls until the original
	function exits.
+
Another usage of *Silent* is with binding commands *Key*, *PointerKey*
and *Mouse*, this disables error messages.
+
*Silent* also disables the error message for non-existent commands.
Note: This command is treated as a prefix to its _command_. Expansion
of the command line is done as if *Silent* was not there.
+
Examples:
+

....
Silent Move 0 0
Silent User_defined_function
# do not complain on keyboards without "Help" key
Silent Key Help R A Popup HelpMenu
....

*UnsetEnv* [_variable_]::
	Unset an environment variable, similar to shell's export or unsetenv
	command. The _variable_ then is removed from the environment array
	inherited by processes started directly by fvwm.

*Wait* _window_::
	This command is intended to be used in fvwm functions only. It causes
	execution of a function to pause until a new window matching _window_
	appears. This can be a window's name, class, or resource string. It
	may contain the wildcards '*' and '?', which are matched in the usual
	Unix filename manner. This is particularly useful in the
	"InitFunction" if you are trying to start windows on specific
	desktops:
+

....
AddToFunc InitFunction
 + I Exec exec xterm -geometry 80x64+0+0
 + I Wait xterm
 + I GotoDesk 0 2
 + I Exec exec xmh -font fixed -geometry \
 507x750+0+0
 + I Wait xmh
 + I GotoDesk 0 0
....

+
The above function starts an xterm on the current desk, waits for it
to map itself, then switches to desk 2 and starts an xmh. After the
xmh window appears control moves to desk 0.
+
Fvwm remains partially functional during a wait, but any input from
the modules is queued up and processed only after the window appears
or the command is aborted. For example, windows can not be focused
with *FvwmIconMan* or *FvwmPager* during a wait.
+
You can escape from a *Wait* pause by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Escape (where Alt is
the first modifier). To redefine this key sequence see the *EscapeFunc* command.

*Status* _On | Off_::
	Turns status either On or Off. This sends information in JSON format
	down a named pipe (set via FVWM_STATUS_PIPE env var) about the current
	desks and number of windows, etc. This is meant to provide a fast
	means of supplying third-party tools information about what's
	happening in Fvwm. For example, the JSON could be manipulated and sent
	to tools such as _lemonbar_, _polybar_, etc.
+
The format of the JSON blob looks like this:
+

....
{
    "version": 3,
    "current_screen": "HDMI2",
    "screens": {
        "HDMI2": {
	    "randr_order": 0,
            "current_client": "n6tadam@shuttle: ~",
            "desktops": {
                "0": {
                    "number": 0,
                    "is_urgent": false,
                    "is_current": true,
                    "number_of_clients": 5
                },
            },
        },
     },
}
....

+
These sections repeat for all screens/groups/etc, depending on how
many there are of each.

=== Conditional Commands

Conditional commands are commands that are only executed if certain
conditions are met. Most conditional commands work on windows, like
*Next*, *ThisWindow* or *All*. There is one conditional command, *Test*,
that works on global conditions unrelated to windows. The syntax of the
conditions is described below. For readability, the list of conditions
is located at the end of this section.

*Return Codes*::
	All commands in this section (unless specifically stated for the
	command) also have a return code that can be 1 (if the condition was
	met) or 0 (if the condition was not met). Some commands may return -1
	which means that an error occurred and the return code is useless. The
	*Break* command returns -2. Additionally, the return codes of commands
	run in a complex functions are passed to the invoking complex
	function. The return code is used by the *TestRc* command. Please
	refer to the commands' description for examples. The return code can
	also be accessed through the variable _$[cond.rc]_. Non conditional
	commands do not modify the return code of the last conditional
	command. Important note: return codes are only defined inside
	functions created with the *AddToFunc* command and are not inherited
	by sub functions. To run a command without altering the return code,
	the *KeepRc* command can be used.

*The Ring of Windows*::
	Fvwm stores windows in a ring internally. Think of the focused window
	as a cursor on the current position in the ring. The *Next* command
	and many other commands search forwards through the ring for a
	matching window, and *Prev* searches backwards. The windows in the
	ring are either ordered by creation time (if the
	_!FPSortWindowlistByFocus_, _NeverFocus_ or _MouseFocus_ styles are
	used) or by the last time they had the focus.

*List of Conditional Commands*::
	*All* [_options_] [(_conditions_)] _command_:::
	Execute _command_ on all windows meeting the conditions. It returns 1
	if any window matches the condition and 0 otherwise. The execution
	starts at the top of the window ring and continues towards the bottom.
	The _options_ can be any combination of _Reverse_ and _UseStack_. If
	the option _Reverse_ is given the execution order is reversed. The
	option _UseStack_ makes All use the stacking order instead of the
	window ring when walking through windows. See the *Conditions* section
	for a list of conditions.
+
This command implies the conditions _CirculateHit_, _CirculateHitIcon_
and _CirculateHitShaded_. They can be turned off by specifying
_!CirculateHit_ etc. explicitly.
+
*Any* [(_conditions_)] _command_:::
	Performs _command_ if any window which satisfies all _conditions_
	exists. The command is run in the context of the root window. See
	the *Conditions* section for a list of conditions.
+
*Break* [_levels_]:::
	If the break command is used in a function, function execution is
	terminated immediately. Further commands of the function are not
	processed. Normally, all nested invocations of complex functions are
	left. An optional integer number _levels_ may be given to break out
	of the given number of nested functions and continue execution of a
	higher level function. The *Break* command always has the return
	code -2. Example:
+
....
AddToFunc PickWindowRaiseAndDeiconify
+ I Pick
+ I TestRc (Error) Break
+ I Raise
+ I Iconify off
....
+
*Current* [(_conditions_)] _command_:::
	Performs _command_ on the currently focused window if it satisfies
	all _conditions_. See the *Conditions* section for a list of
	conditions.
+
This command implies the conditions _CirculateHit_,
_CirculateHitIcon_ and _CirculateHitShaded_. They can be turned off
by specifying _!CirculateHit_ etc. explicitly.
+
*Direction* [FromPointer] _direction_ [(_conditions_)] _command_:::
	Performs _command_ (typically *Focus*) on a window in the given
	direction which satisfies all _conditions_. Normally, the center of
	the currently focused window or the context window in which the
	command was invoked is taken as the starting point. Lacking such a
	window, or when the _FromPointer_ option is given, the current
	position of the pointer is taken as the starting point. The
	_direction_ may be one of "North", "Northeast", "East", "Southeast",
	"South", "Southwest", "West", "Northwest" and "Center". Which window
	*Direction* selects depends on angle and distance between the center
	points of the windows. Closer windows are considered a better match
	than those farther away. The _Center_ direction simply selects the
	window closest to the starting point. Returns -1 if an invalid
	direction was given. See the *Conditions* section for a list of
	conditions.
+
*KeepRc* _command_:::
	Runs the _command_ but does not alter the return code of the
	previous command. Note: *KeepRc* is treated as a prefix to its
	_command_. Expansion of the command line is done as if *KeepRc* was
	not there.
+
*Next* [(_conditions_)] _command_:::
	Performs _command_ (typically *Focus*) on the next window which
	satisfies all _conditions_. If the command is running in a window
	context, it starts looking for a matching window from there.
	Otherwise it starts at the focused window. See *Conditions* section
	for a list of conditions.
+
*None* [(_conditions_)] _command_:::
	Performs _command_ if no window which satisfies all _conditions_
	exists. The command is run in the context of the root window.
	Returns 1 if no window matches the conditions and 0 otherwise. See
	*Conditions* section for a list of conditions.
+
This command implies the conditions _CirculateHit_,
_CirculateHitIcon_ and _CirculateHitShaded_. They can be turned off
by specifying _!CirculateHit_ etc. explicitly.
+
*NoWindow* _command_:::
	Performs _command_, but removes the window context if any. This is
	not really a conditional command, but a prefix that may be useful in
	menu items that should operate without a window even if such menu is
	bound to window decorations.
+
*Pick* [(_conditions_)] _command_:::
	*Pick* works like *Function* if invoked in the context of a window.
	If invoked in the root window, it first asks the user to pick a
	window and then executes the _command_ in the context of that
	window. This avoids annoying multiple selections with complex
	functions. The command is executed only if the given _conditions_
	are met. Returns -1 if no window was selected. See *Conditions*
	section for a list of conditions.
+
This command implies the conditions _CirculateHit_,
_CirculateHitIcon_ and _CirculateHitShaded_. They can be turned off
by specifying _!CirculateHit_ etc. explicitly.
+
*PointerWindow* [(_conditions_)] _command_:::
	Performs _command_ if the window under the pointer satisfies all
	_conditions_. Returns -1 if there is no window under the pointer.
	See *Conditions* section for a list of conditions.
+
This command implies the conditions _CirculateHit_,
_CirculateHitIcon_ and _CirculateHitShaded_. They can be turned off
by specifying _!CirculateHit_ etc. explicitly.
+
*Prev* [(_conditions_)] _command_:::
	Performs _command_ (typically *Focus*) on the previous window which
	satisfies all _conditions_. If the command is running in a window
	context, it starts looking for a matching window from there.
	Otherwise it starts at the focused window. See *Conditions* section
	for a list of conditions.
+
*ScanForWindow* [FromPointer] _dir1_ _dir2_ [(_conditions_)] _command_:::
	Performs _command_ (typically *Focus*) on a window in the given
	direction which satisfies all _conditions_. Normally, the center of
	the currently focused window or the context window in which the
	command was invoked is taken as the starting point. Lacking such a
	window, or when the _FromPointer_ option is given, the current
	position of the pointer is taken as the starting point. The
	direction _dir1_ may be one of "North", "NorthEast", "East",
	"SouthEast", "South", "SouthWest", "West", and "NorthWest". Which
	window *ScanForWindow* selects depends first on the position along
	the primary axis given by _dir1_. If any windows have the exact same
	coordinate along the primary axis, the secondary direction is used
	to order the windows. The direction _dir2_ may be one of the same
	set of values as _dir1_. If _dir2_ is not perfectly perpendicular to
	_dir1_, ScanForWindow returns a failure. When using ScanForWindow
	repeatedly with the same arguments, it is guaranteed that all
	windows matching the conditions will eventually be found. If the
	focus reaches a limit along the primary axis, it will wrap around to
	the opposite side. Returns -1 if an invalid direction was given. See
	*Conditions* section for a list of conditions.
+
*Test* [(_test-conditions_)] _command_:::
	Performs _command_ if all _test-conditions_ are satisfied. The
	_test-conditions_ are keywords with possible arguments from the list
	below and are separated by commas or whitespace. They include:
	_Version operator x.y.z_, _EnvIsSet varname_, _EnvMatch varname
	pattern_, _EdgeHasPointer direction_, _EdgeIsActive direction_,
	_Start_, _Init_, _Restart_, _Exit_, _Quit_, _ToRestart_, _True_,
	_False_, _F_, _R_, _W_, _X_ and _I_. A test-condition prefixed with
	"!" is negated.
+
The _Version_ _operator x.y.z_ test-condition is fulfilled if the
logical condition of the expression is true. Valid _operator_ values
are: _>=_, _>_, _<=_, _<_, _==_ and _!=_.
+
Example:
+

....
Test (Version >= 2.5.11) Echo 2.5.11 or later.
....

+
The _EnvIsSet_ _varname_ test-condition is true if the given
environment variable is set. The _EnvMatch_ _varname pattern_
test-condition is true if _pattern_ matches the given environment or
infostore variable value. (See *InfoStoreAdd*). The pattern may
contain special "*" and "?" chars. The "varname" is coded without
the leading dollar sign ($).
+
The _EdgeHasPointer_ [_direction_] test-condition is true if the
edge in the given direction currently contains the pointer. The
_EdgeIsActive_ [_direction_] test-condition is true if the edge in
the given direction currently is active. An edge is active, and can
contain a pointer if either a command is bound to it or edge scroll
is available in that direction. The direction may be one of *
Any__,__ North__,__ Top__,__ Up__,__ West__,__ Left__,__ South__,__
Bottom__, __ Down__,__ Right* and * East__. If no direction is
specified __Any* is assumed.
+
The _Start_ test-condition is the same as either _Init_ or
_Restart_. It is only true on startup or restart prior and during
*StartFunction* execution. The _Exit_ test-condition is the same as
either _Quit_ or _ToRestart_. It is only valid on shutdown during
*ExitFunction* function execution.
+
The _True_ and _False_ test-conditions are unconditionally true and
false.
+
Additionally, if a test-condition name is not recognized, the Error
return code is set and the command is not executed.
+
The _F_ _file_, _R_ _file_, _W_ _file_, _X_ _file_ and _I_ _file_
test-conditions test for existence of the given [F]ile (possibly
with [R]ead/[W]rite permissions), e[X]ecutable (in _$PATH_), or the
[I]mage (in ImagePath).
+
Example:
+

....
AddToFunc StartFunction I Test (Init) Exec exec xterm

AddToFunc VerifyVersion
+ I Test (Version 2.5.*) Echo 2.5.x detected
+ I TestRc (NoMatch) \
Test (!Version 2.6.*) Echo Future version
+ I TestRc (NoMatch) \
Echo 2.6.x is detected

Test (F $[FVWM_USERDIR]/local-config) Read local-config
Test (X xterm-utf16) Exec exec xterm-utf16
....
+
*TestRc* [(+++[!]+++_returncode_)] _command_:::
	Performs _command_ if the last conditional command returned the
	value _returncode_. Instead of the numeric values 0 (no match), 1
	(match), -1 (error), and -2 (break) the symbolic names "_NoMatch_",
	"_Match_", "_Error_" and "_Break_" can be used. If no _returncode_
	is given, the default 0 is assumed. If the return code is prefixed
	with '!', the command is executed if _returncode_ does not match the
	value returned by the conditional command. The *TestRc* command can
	only be used inside functions. If the _command_ is another
	conditional command, the previous return code is replaced by the new
	one. Example:
+

....
AddToFunc ToggleXterm
+ I All (my_xtermwindow) Close
+ I TestRc (NoMatch) Exec xterm -T my_xtermwindow
....
+
*ThisWindow* [(_conditions_)] command:::
	*ThisWindow* executes the specified _command_ in the context of the
	current operand window. If there is no operand window (it is invoked
	in the root window), the command is ignored. *ThisWindow* is never
	interactive. The command is executed only if the given _conditions_
	are met. It returns -1 if used outside a window context. See
	*Conditions* section for a list of conditions.
+
This command implies the conditions _CirculateHit_,
_CirculateHitIcon_ and _CirculateHitShaded_. They can be turned off
by specifying "!CirculateHit" etc. explicitly.
+
*WindowId* [_id_] [(_conditions_)] | [root] _command_:::
	The *WindowId* command looks for a specific window _id_ and runs the
	specified _command_ on it. The second form of syntax retrieves the
	window id of the root window. The window indicated by
	_id_ may belong to a window not managed by fvwm. Although most
	commands can not operate on such windows, there are some exceptions,
	for example the *WarpToWindow* command. Returns -1 if no window with
	the given id exists. See *Conditions* section for a list of conditions.
+
This command implies the conditions _CirculateHit_,
_CirculateHitIcon_ and _CirculateHitShaded_. They can be turned off
by specifying _!CirculateHit_ etc. explicitly.
+
Examples:
+

....
WindowId 0x34567890 Raise
WindowId root 1 WarpToWindow 50 50
WindowId $0 (Silly_Popup) Delete
....

+
In the past this command was mostly useful for functions used with
the *WindowList* command, or for selective processing of *FvwmEvent*
calls (as in the last example), but currently these handler
functions are called within a window context, so this command is not
really needed in these cases. Still it may be useful if, for
example, the window id should be stored in the environment variable
for a further proceeding.

+
....
Pick SetEnv BOOKMARKED_WINDOW $[w.id]
WindowId $[BOOKMARKED_WINDOW] WarpToWindow
....


*Conditions*::
	The _conditions_ that may be given as an argument to any conditional
	command are a list of keywords separated by commas, enclosed in
	parentheses. Unless stated otherwise, conditional commands accept all
	the conditions listed below. Note that earlier versions of fvwm
	required the conditions to be separated by whitespace instead of
	commas and enclosed in brackets instead of parentheses (this is still
	supported for backward compatibility).
+
In addition, the _conditions_ may include one or more window names to
match to. If more than one window name is given, all of them must
match. The window name, icon name, class, and resource are considered
when attempting to find a match. Each name may include the wildcards
'*' and '?', and may consist of two or more alternatives, separated by
the character '|', which acts as an OR operator. (If OR operators are
used, they must not be separated by spaces from the names.) Each
window name can begin with '!', which prevents _command_ if any of the
window name, icon name, class or resource match. However, '!' must not
be applied to individual names in a group separated by OR operators;
it may only be applied to the beginning of the group, and then it
operates on the whole group.
+
Examples:
+
....
Next ("Netscape|konqueror|Mozilla*") WarpToWindow 99 90
....
+
This goes to the next web browser window, no matter which of the three
named web browsers is being used.
+
....
Next ("Mozilla*", "Bookmark*") WarpToWindow 99 90
....
+
This goes to Mozilla's bookmark manager window, ignoring other Mozilla
windows and other browsers' bookmark windows.
+
....
All ("XTerm|rxvt", !console) Iconify
....

+
This iconifies all the xterm and rxvt windows on the current page,
except that the one named "console" (with the -name option to xterm)
is excluded.
+

....
Next (!"FvwmPager|FvwmForm*|FvwmButtons") Raise
Next (!FvwmPager, !FvwmForm*, !FvwmButtons) Raise
....

+
These two commands are equivalent; either one raises the next window
which is not one of the named fvwm modules.
+
Any condition can be negated by using a an exclamation mark ('!')
directly in front of its name.
+
_AcceptsFocus_, _AnyScreen_, _CirculateHit_, _CirculateHitIcon_,
_CirculateHitShaded_, _Closable_, _CurrentDesk_, _CurrentGlobalPage_,
_CurrentGlobalPageAnyDesk_, _CurrentPage_, _CurrentPageAnyDesk_,
_CurrentScreen_, _Desk_, _FixedPosition_, _FixedSize_, _Focused_,
_HasBorders_, _HasHandles_, _HasPointer_, _HasTitle_, _TitleAtTop_,
_TitleAtBottom_, _TitleAtLeft_, _TitleAtRight_, _Iconic_,
_Iconifiable_, _Layer [n]_, _Maximizable_, _Maximized_, _Overlapped_,
_PlacedByButton n_, _PlacedByButton3_, _PlacedByFvwm_, _Raised_, _Shaded_,
_State n_, _Sticky_, _StickyAcrossDesks_, _StickyAcrossPages_, _StickyIcon_,
_StickyAcrossDesksIcon_, _StickyAcrossPagesIcon_, _Transient_,
_Visible_.
+
The _AcceptsFocus_ condition excludes all windows that do not want the
input focus (the application has set the "Input hints" for the window
to False) and do not use the _Lenience_ option of the *Style* command.
Also, all windows using the _NeverFocus_ style are ignored. Note:
_!Lenience_ is equivalent to the deprecated option _NoLenience_.
+
With the _AnyScreen_ condition used together with any of the
_Current..._ conditions, windows that do not intersect the screen
containing the mouse pointer are considered for a match too. For
example:
+

....
# Focus next window on current page,
# regardless of screen
Next (CurrentPage, AnyScreen) Focus
....

+
The _CirculateHit_ and _CirculateHitIcon_ options override the
_CirculateSkip_ and _CirculateSkipIcon_ *Style* attributes for normal
or iconic windows. The _CirculateHitShaded_ option overrides the
_CirculateSkipShaded_ *Style.* All three options are turned on by
default for the *Current* command. They can be turned off by
specifying _!CirculateHit_ etc. explicitly. Note: Do not confuse these
conditions with the style options of the same name. Specifically,
+

....
Style foo CirculateSkip
Next (foo, CirculateHit) ...
....

+
is not the same as
+

....
Style foo CirculateHit ...
Next (foo)
....

+
The prior selects windows with the name foo only in the Next command.
In the second example, these windows are always matched in all
conditional commands.
+
The _Closable_ condition matches only windows that are allowed to be
closed.
+
The _CurrentDesk_ condition matches only windows that are on the
current desk.
+
The _CurrentGlobalPage_ condition matches only windows that are on the
current page of the current desk, regardless of which screen the
window is on. This condition implicitly activates the _CurrentDesk_
condition.
+
The _CurrentGlobalPageAnyDesk_ condition matches only windows that are
on the current page of any desk, regardless of RandR screen .
+
The _CurrentPage_ condition matches only windows that are on the
current page of the current desk. This condition implicitly activates
the _CurrentDesk_ condition.
+
The _CurrentPageAnyDesk_ and _CurrentScreen_ conditions matches only
windows that are on the current page of any desk.
+
The _Screen [name]_ condition matches only windows which are on the
specified screen.
+
The _Desk [n]_ condition matches only windows which are on the
specified desk.
+
The _FixedPosition_ condition excludes all windows that do not have a
fixed position, either set through WM hints or the *Style* option
_FixedPosition_. Example:
+

....
DestroyFunc ToggleFixedGeometry
AddToFunc   ToggleFixedGeometry
+ I Pick (FixedPosition) \
WindowStyle VariablePosition, VariableSize
+ I TestRc (NoMatch) WindowStyle FixedPosition, FixedSize
....

+
The _FixedSize_ condition excludes all windows that do not have a
fixed size, either set through WM hints or the *Style* option
_FixedSize_.
+
The _Focused_ matches on the window that currently has the keyboard
focus. This is not useful for the *Current* command but can be used
with the other conditional commands.
+
The _HasBorders_ condition excludes all windows that do not have borders.
+
The _HasHandles_ condition excludes all windows that do not have
resize handles.
+
The _HasPointer_ condition excludes all windows that do not contain
the pointer.
+
The _HasTitle_ condition excludes all windows that do not have a titlebar.
+
The _TitleAtTop_, _TitleAtBottom_, _TitleAtLeft_, _TitleAtRight_ conditions
test for the titlebar at that window location.
+
The _Iconic_ condition matches only iconic windows.
+
The _Iconifiable_ condition matches only windows that are allowed to
be iconified.
+
The _Layer [n]_ condition matches only windows on the specified layer.
The optional argument of the _Layer_ condition defaults to the layer
of the focused window. The negation _!Layer_ switches off the _Layer_
condition.
+
The _Maximizable_ condition matches only windows that are allowed to
be maximized.
+
The _Maximized_ condition matches only maximized windows.
+
The _Overlapped_ condition matches only windows that are overlapped by
other windows on the same layer (or unmanaged windows if the option
_RaiseOverUnmanaged_ of the *BugOpts* command is used). Note that this
condition can be slow if you have many windows or if
RaiseOverUnmanaged is used and the connection to the X server is slow.
+
The _PlacedByButton n_ condition is fulfilled if the last interactive
motion of the window (with the *Move* command or as _ManualPlacement_)
was ended by pressing mouse button _n_. Example:
+

....
Mouse   1 T     A       Function MoveWindow

DestroyFunc MoveWindow
AddToFunc MoveWindow
+ C Move
+ C ThisWindow (PlacedByButton 5) WindowShade off
+ C TestRc (Match) Maximize on 0 100
+ C ThisWindow (PlacedByButton 4) WindowShade on
....

+
The _PlacedByButton3_ condition has the same meaning as
_PlacedByButton_ 3. It remains only for backward compatibility.
+
The _PlacedByFvwm_ condition excludes all windows that have been
placed manually or by using the user or program position hint.
+
The _Raised_ conditions matches only windows that are fully visible on
the current viewport and not overlapped by any other window.
+
The _Shaded_ conditions matches only shaded windows (see *WindowShade*
command).
+
The _State n_ or _!State n_ conditions match only windows with the
specified integer state set (or unset). See the *State* command for
details. The argument may range from 0 to 31.
+
The _Sticky_, _StickyAcrossDesks_ and _StickyAcrossPages_ match only
windows that are currently sticky, sticky across all desks or sticky
across all pages. Please refer to the *Style* options with the same
name and the commands *Stick*, *StickAcrossDesks* and
*StickAcrossPages* for details.
+
The _StickyIcon_, _StickyAcrossDesksIcon_ and _StickyAcrossPagesIcon_
match only windows that become sticky, sticky across all desks or
sticky across all pages when they are in iconified state.
+
The _Transient_ condition matches only windows that have the
"transient" property set by the application. This it usually the case
for application popup menus and dialogs. The *FvwmIdent* module can be
used to find out whether a specific window is transient.
+
The _Visible_ condition matches only windows that are at least
partially visible on the current viewport and not completely
overlapped by other windows.

=== Module Commands

Fvwm maintains a database of module configuration lines in a form

....
*<ModuleName>: <Config-Resource>
....

where _<ModuleName>_ is either a real module name or an alias.

This database is initially filled from config file (or from output of
*-cmd* config command), and can be later modified either by user (via
*FvwmCommand*) or by modules.

When modules are run, they read appropriate portion of database. (The
concept of this database is similar to one used in X resource database).

Commands for manipulating module configuration database are described
below.

**+*+** _module_config_line_::
	Defines a module configuration. _module_config_line_ consists of a
	module name (or a module alias) and a module resource line. The new
	syntax allows a delimiter, a colon and optional spaces, between the
	module name and the rest of the line, this is recommended to avoid
	conflicts.
+

....
*FvwmPager: WindowBorderWidth 1
*FvwmButtons-TopRight: Geometry 100x100-0+0
*FvwmButtons-Bottom: Geometry +0-0
....

*DestroyModuleConfig* _module_config_::
	Deletes module configuration entries, so that new configuration lines
	may be entered instead. This also sometimes the only way to turn back
	some module settings, previously defined. This changes the way a
	module runs during a fvwm session without restarting. Wildcards can be
	used for portions of the name as well.
+
The new non-conflicting syntax allows a delimiter, a colon and
optional spaces between the module name and the rest of the line. In
this case a module name (or alias) can't have wildcards.
+

....
DestroyModuleConfig FvwmButtons*
DestroyModuleConfig FvwmForm: Fore
DestroyModuleConfig FvwmIconMan: Tips*
....

*KillModule* _modulename_ [_modulealias_]::
	Causes the module which was invoked with name _modulename_ to be
	killed. The name may include wildcards. If _modulealias_ is given,
	only modules started with the given alias are killed.
+

....
# kill all pagers
KillModule FvwmPager

Module FvwmEvent SoundEvent
KillModule FvwmEvent SoundEvent
....

*Module* _modulename_ [_moduleparams_]::
	Specifies a module with its optional parameters which should be
	spawned. Currently several modules, including *FvwmButtons*,
	*FvwmEvent*, *FvwmForm*, *FvwmPager*, *FvwmScript* support aliases.
	Aliases are useful if more than one instance of the module should be
	spawned. Aliases may be configured separately using *** syntax. To
	start a module *FvwmForm* using an alias _MyForm_, the following
	syntax may be used:
+

....
Module FvwmForm MyForm
....

+
At the current time the available modules (included with fvwm) are
*FvwmAnimate* (produces animation effects when a window is iconified
or de-iconified), *FvwmAuto* (an auto raise module), *FvwmBacker* (to
change the background when you change desktops), *FvwmBanner* (to
display a spiffy XBM, XPM, PNG or SVG), *FvwmButtons* (brings up a
customizable tool bar), *FvwmCommandS* (a command server to use with
shell's FvwmCommand client), *FvwmConsole* (to execute fvwm commands
directly), *FvwmEvent* (trigger various actions by events), *FvwmForm*
(to bring up dialogs), *FvwmIconMan* (a flexible icon manager),
*FvwmIdent* (to get window info), *FvwmPager* (a mini version of the
desktop), *FvwmPerl* (a Perl manipulator and preprocessor), *FvwmProxy*
(to locate and control obscured windows by using small proxy windows),
*FvwmRearrange* (to rearrange windows), *FvwmScript* (another powerful
dialog toolkit), These modules have their own man pages. There may be
other modules out on there as well.
+
Modules can be short lived transient programs or, like *FvwmButtons* ,
can remain for the duration of the X session. Modules are terminated
by the window manager prior to restarts and quits, if possible. See
the introductory section on modules. The keyword *Module* may be
omitted if _modulename_ is distinct from all fvwm commands.

*ModuleListenOnly* _modulename_ [_moduleparams_]::
	This command works like the *Module* command, but fvwm never sends any
	messages to the module. This may be handy to write a module as a shell
	script that is triggered by external events without the burden to
	answer packets sent by fvwm. For example, a module written as a shell
	script may change labels of the *FvwmButtons* module to implement a
	simple clock.

*ModulePath* _path_::
	Specifies a colon separated list of directories in which to search for
	modules. To find a module, fvwm searches each directory in turn and
	uses the first file found. Directory names on the list do not need
	trailing slashes.
+
The *ModulePath* may contain environment variables such as _$HOME_ (or
_$\{HOME}_). Further, a '+' in the _path_ is expanded to the previous
value of the _path_, allowing easy appending or prepending to the
_path_.
+
For example:
+

....
ModulePath ${HOME}/lib/fvwm/modules:+
....

+
The directory containing the standard modules is available via the
environment variable _$FVWM_MODULEDIR_.
*ModuleSynchronous* [Expect _string_] [Timeout _secs_] _modulename_::
The *ModuleSynchronous* command is very similar to *Module*. Fvwm
stops processing any commands and user input until the module sends a
string beginning with "NOP FINISHED STARTUP" back to fvwm. If the
optional _Timeout_ is given fvwm gives up if the module sent no input
back to fvwm for _secs_ seconds. If the _Expect_ option is given, fvwm
waits for the given _string_ instead. *ModuleSynchronous* should only
be used during fvwm startup to enforce the order in which modules are
started. This command is intended for use with the (currently
hypothetical) module that should be in place before other modules are
started.
+
**Warning**: It is quite easy to hang fvwm with this command, even if a
timeout is given. Be extra careful choosing the string to wait for.
Although all modules in the fvwm distribution send back the "NOP
FINISHED STARTUP" string once they have properly started up, this may
not be the case for third party modules. Moreover, you can try to
escape from a locked *ModuleSynchronous* command by using the key
sequence
+
(see the *EscapeFunc*).

*ModuleTimeout* _timeout_::
	Specifies how many seconds fvwm waits for a module to respond. If the
	module does not respond within the time limit then fvwm kills it.
	_timeout_ must be greater than zero, or it is reset to the default
	value of 30 seconds.

*SendToModule* _modulename_ _string_::
	Sends an arbitrary string (no quotes required) to all modules, whose
	alias or name matching _modulename_, which may contain wildcards. This
	only makes sense if the module is set up to understand and deal with
	these strings though. Can be used for module to module communication,
	or implementation of more complex commands in modules.

=== Session Management Commands

*Quit*::
	Exits fvwm, generally causing X to exit too.

*Restart* [_window_manager_ [_params_]]::
	Causes fvwm to restart itself if _window_manager_ is left blank, or to
	switch to an alternate window manager (or other fvwm version) if
	_window_manager_ is specified. If the window manager is not in your
	default search path, then you should use the full path name for
	_window_manager_.
+
This command should not have a trailing ampersand. The command can
have optional parameters with simple shell-like syntax. You can use
_~_ (is expanded to the user's home directory) and environmental
variables _$VAR_ or _$\{VAR}_. Here are several examples:
+

....
Key F1 R N Restart
Key F1 R N Restart fvwm1 -f .fvwmrc
Key F1 R N Restart xterm -n '"X console"' -T \"X\ console\" -e fvwm
....

+
Note, currently with multi headed displays, restart of fvwms on
different screens works independently.
+
*Restart* *--pass-args* _window_manager_::
The same as *Restart* without parameters but the name for the current
window manager is replaced with the specified _window_manager_ and
original arguments are preserved.
+
*Restart* *--dont-preserve-state* [_other-params_]::
The same as
+

....
Restart [other-params]
....

+
but it does not save any window states over the restart.
+
Without this option, *Restart* preserves most per-window state by
writing it to a file named _.fs-restart-$HOSTDISPLAY_ in the user's
home directory.

*SaveSession*::
	Causes a session manager (if any) to save the session. This command
	does not work for xsm, it seems that xsm does not implement this
	functionality. Use Unix signals to manage xsm remotely.

*SaveQuitSession*::
	Causes a session manager (if any) to save and then shutdown the
	session. This command does not work for xsm, it seems that xsm does
	not implement this functionality. Use Unix signals to manage xsm
	remotely.

=== Colorsets

Colorsets are a powerful method to control colors. Colorsets create
appearance resources that are shared by fvwm and its modules. When a
colorset is modified all parts of fvwm react to that change. A colorset
includes a foreground color, background color, shadow and highlight
color (often based on the background color), background face (this
includes images and all kinds of gradients). There is a way to render
background face and specify other color operations.

*Colorset* _num_ [_options_]::
	Creates or modifies colorset _num_. Colorsets are identified by this
	number. The number can start at zero and can be a very large number.
+
Warning: The highest colorset number used determines memory
consumption. Thus, if you define 'Colorset 100000', the memory for
100001 colorsets is used. Keep your colorset numbers as small as
possible.
+
By convention, colorsets are numbered like this:
+

....
# 0 = Default colors
# 1 = Inactive windows
# 2 = Active windows
# 3 = Inactive menu entry and menu background
# 4 = Active menu entry
# 5 = greyed out menu entry (only bg used)
# 6 = module foreground and background
# 7 = hilight colors
....

+
If you need to have more colors and do not want to reinvent the wheel,
you may use the convention used in fvwm-themes, it defines the meaning
of the first 40 colorsets for nearly all purposes:
+
http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/doc/colorsets
+
Each colorset has four colors, an optional pixmap and an optional
shape mask. The four colors are used by modules as the foreground,
background, highlight and shadow colors. When a colorset is created it
defaults to a foreground of black and background of gray. The
background and foreground are marked as "average" and "contrast" (see
later) so that just specifying a pixmap or gradient gives sensible
results.
+
_options_ is a comma separated list containing some of the keywords:
fg, Fore, Foreground, bg, Back, Background, hi, Hilite, Hilight, sh,
Shade, Shadow, fgsh, Pixmap, TiledPixmap, AspectPixmap, Transparent,
RootTransparent, Shape, TiledShape, AspectShape, NoShape, ?Gradient,
Tint, fgTint, bgTint, Alpha, fgAlpha, Dither, NoDither, IconTint,
IconAlpha, Plain.
+
_fg_, _Fore_ and _Foreground_ take a color name as an argument and set
the foreground color. The special name _Contrast_ may be used to
select a color that contrasts well with the background color. To reset
the foreground color to the default value you can simply omit the
color name.
+
_bg_, _Back_ and _Background_ take a color name as an argument and set
the background color. It also sets the highlight and shadow colors to
values that give a 3d effect unless these have been explicitly set
with the options below. The special name _Average_ may be used to
select a color that is the average color of the pixmap. If the pixmap
is tinted with the _Tint_ option, the tint is not taken in account in
the computation of the average color. You should use the _bgTint_
option to get the "real" average color. The background color is reset
to the default value if the color name is omitted.
+
_hi_, _Hilite_ and _Hilight_ take a color name as an argument and set
the highlight color. If the highlight color is not explicitly set, the
default is to calculate it from the background color. To switch back
to the default behavior the color name can be omitted.
+
_sh_, _Shade_ and _Shadow_ take a color name as an argument and set
the shadow color. If the shadow color is not explicitly set, the
default is to calculate it from the background color. To switch back
to the default behavior the color name can be omitted.
+
_fgsh_ takes a color name as an argument and sets the color used by
the shadowing font effect. See the *Font Shadow Effects* section of
the fvwm man page. By default this color is computed from the
foreground and background colors. To switch back to the default the
color name can be omitted.
+
_Pixmap_, _TiledPixmap_ and _AspectPixmap_ take a file name as an
argument, search the *ImagePath* and use it as the background pixmap.
Any transparent parts are filled with the background color. Not
specifying a file name removes any existing image from the colorset.
_TiledPixmap_ produces repeated copies of the image with no scaling,
_Pixmap_ causes the image to be stretched to fit whatever object the
colorset is applied to and _AspectPixmap_ stretches to fit but retains
the image aspect ratio.
+
_Transparent_ creates a transparent background pixmap. The pixmap is
used as a window background to achieve root transparency. For this you
should use the _ParentalRelativity_ option to the *Style* command. A
subsequent root background change may be detected or not, this depends
on the program used to set the background. If you use *fvwm-root*,
*xsetbg* (xli), *FvwmBacker* with solid or colorset colors or a recent
version of *Esetroot* (>= 9.2) a background change is detected. If
background changes are not detected (e.g., if you use *xv* or
*xsetroot*) you can force detection by using the *-d* option of
fvwm-root:
+

....
xv -root -quit mybg.png; fvwm-root -d
....

+
Due to the way X implements transparency no guarantees can be made
that the desired effect can be achieved. The application may even
crash. If you experience any problems with this option, do not use it.
+
Using outline move and resize (see the *OpaqueMoveSize* command and
the _ResizeOpaque_ *Style* option) as well as setting the
_WindowShadeShrinks_ style may help. The transparency achieved with
_Transparent_ depends on whether the colorset is applied to the
foreground or the background of a window. In the second case the
transparency is relative to the parent window of the window on which
the colorset is defined. For example:
+

....
Colorset 12 VGradient 200 grey30 grey60
Colorset 17 Transparent
*FvwmIconMan: Colorset 12
*FvwmIconMan: PlainColorset 17
....

+
gives an IconMan with a vertical grey gradient background and the
buttons use the background (by transparency). To obtain a (root)
transparent IconMan:
+

....
Colorset 12 Transparent
Colorset 17 Transparent
Colorset 18 Transparent
Colorset 19 Transparent

*FvwmIconMan: Colorset 12
*FvwmIconMan: PlainColorset 17
*FvwmIconMan: FocusColorset 18
*FvwmIconMan: IconColorset  19
....

+
The Colorset IconMan option defines the IconMan window background, but
the PlainColorset and the FocusColorset are drawn on the foreground.
So, the transparency of the IconMan buttons is achieved by drawing
nothing. Now if this IconMan is swallowed in an FvwmButtons as:
+

....
FvwmButtons:(Colorset 10, Swallow "FvwmIconMan" 'FvwmIconMan')
....

+
then, *FvwmIconMan* becomes a child of *FvwmButtons* and it is
transparent relative to *FvwmButtons*. So, in this case *FvwmIconMan*
uses Colorset 10 as background. If you want root transparency use the
_RootTransparent_ option. *FvwmButtons* *FvwmIconMan*, and
*FvwmIdent*, are relatively simple. There is one main colorset option
which defines the background of the window and the other colorsets (if
any) are drawn on the foreground. The case of *FvwmProxy* is simpler,
the two colorsets refer to the window backgrounds. *FvwmPager* is more
complicated as almost everything in the pager are windows with some
parental relations (the mini windows are the child and the desktops
are the parents and all this is complicated by the hilighted page).
So, the colorsets apply to the background of these windows. You should
experiment. For *FvwmForm* and *FvwmScript* the situation is similar.
There is a main window (a child of the root window) which corresponds
to the main colorset and most of the widgets are windows which are
children of the main window. _Tint_ may work or not with the
_Transparent_ option. When the colorset is drawn on the foreground
_Tint_ should work. In some cases, tinting may be very slow. Tinting
may work with fvwm menu (without animation). Tinting may work better
if your X server has backing store enabled (try xdpyinfo to see if
this the case). There is a chance that the backing store support of
your X server does not work well with the terrible hack used to Tint
the ParentRelative Pixmap. So, to get tinted root transparency it is
more safe to use the _RootTransparent_ option.
+
_RootTransparent_ [ _buffer_ ] creates a root transparent background.
To make this option work, you must use an *Esetroot* compatible
program, fvwm-root with the --retain-pixmap option or *FvwmBacker*
with the RetainPixmap option (and colorset or solid backgrounds). The
_buffer_ keyword is useful only when the _Tint_ option is used too.
This speeds up creation of windows which use the colorset (useful for
fvwm menus) at the cost of memory usage. It also speeds up opaque move
and resize which can be unacceptably slow without _buffer_. However,
this option may add a lot of memory to your X server (depending on the
size of the image used to set the background). In summary, using
outline move and resize for modules which use such a colorset may be a
good idea.
+
_Shape_, _TiledShape_ and _AspectShape_ take a file name as an
argument, search the *ImagePath* and use it as the shape bitmap.
_TiledShape_ produces repeated copies of the bitmap with no scaling,
_Shape_ causes the bitmap to be stretched to fit whatever object the
colorset is applied to and _AspectShape_ stretches to fit but retains
the bitmap aspect ratio. If the file is a pixmap in xpm format the
shape mask (all opaque pixels) of the pixmap is used. For png and svg
images, the shape mask is equivalent to all not completely transparent
pixels (alpha > 0).
+
*Warning* Due to the way X11 implements shapes you cannot take back
making windows shaped. You may have to restart fvwm or the shaped
application.
+
_?Gradient ..._ creates a pixmap and stretches it to fit the window.
_?Gradient_ may be one of _HGradient_, _VGradient_, _DGradient_,
_BGradient_, _SGradient_, _CGradient_, _RGradient_ or _YGradient_. The
gradient types are as follows: H is horizontal; V is vertical; D is
diagonal from top left to bottom right; B is a backwards diagonal from
bottom left to top right; S is concentric squares; C is concentric
circles; R is a radar like pattern and Y is a Yin Yang style (but
without the dots). Please refer to the *Color Gradients* section for
the syntax of gradients.
+
_Tint_ takes 2 arguments, a color and a percentage between 0 and 100.
It causes the image defined using _?Pixmap_ or _?Gradient_ to be
tinted with the specified color using the percentage. If the image is
transparent _Tint_ tints only the image part. Unfortunately, a
colorset background specified using the _Transparent_ option can give
strange results. See the _Transparent_ option for details. With no
arguments this option removes the tint.
+
_fgTint_ takes 2 arguments, a color and a percentage between 0 and 100.
It causes the color defined using _fg_ to be tinted with the
specified color using the percentage. With no arguments this option
removes the tint.
+
_bgTint_ takes 2 arguments, a color and a percentage between 0 and 100.
It causes the color defined using _bg_ to be tinted with the
specified color using the percentage. If the _sh_ and _hi_ colors are
not specified, they are recomputed from the tinted bg color. With no
arguments this option removes the tint.
+
_Alpha_ takes a percentage between 0 and 100 as an argument. It causes
fvwm to merge the image defined using _?Pixmap_ or _?Gradient_ with
the _bg_ color using the percentage. If the percentage is 0 the image
is hidden and if it is 100 the image is displayed as usual (no merge).
The default is 100 and it is restored if no argument is given.
+
_fgAlpha_ takes a percentage between 0 and 100 as an argument. It
causes fvwm to merge the text and the colorset background using the
percentage. If the percentage is 0 the text is hidden and if it is 100
the text is displayed as usual (no merge). This option has an effect
only with fonts loaded by Xft, see the *Font Names and Font Loading*
section. The default is 100 and it is restored if no argument is
given.
+
_Dither_ causes fvwm to dither the image defined using _?Pixmap_ or
_?Gradient._ This is useful only with displays with depth less than or
equal to 16 (i.e., on displays which can only display less than 65537
colors at once). The dithering effect lets you simulate having more
colors available that you actually have. _NoDither_ causes fvwm to do
not dither the images. _Dither_ is the default if the depth is less
than or equal to 8 (a screen with 256 colors or less). In depth 15
(32768 colors) and 16 (65536 colors), the default is _NoDither_,
however this effect can be useful with images which contain a lot of
close colors. For example a fine gradient looks more smooth.
+
_IconTint_ takes 2 arguments, a color and a percentage between 0 and 100.
It causes fvwm or a module to tint the "icons" which are rendered
into the colorset background with the specified color using a
percentage. Here "icons" means, fvwm Icons, fvwm menu icons, MiniIcons
which represent applications in various modules, images loaded by
modules (e.g., images specified by the _Icon_ *FvwmButtons* button
option) ...etc. With no arguments this option removes the icon tint.
+
_IconAlpha_ takes a percentage between 0 and 100 as an argument. It
causes fvwm to merge the "icons" which are rendered into the colorset
background using this percentage. The default is 100 and it is
restored if no argument is given.
+
_Note_: It is equivalent to use "Tint a_color rate" and "Alpha a" if a
= 100 and the bg color is a_color. This equivalence does not hold for
IconAlpha and IconTint as the background can be an image or a gradient
(and not a uniform color background). However, in some cases you can
achieve (almost) the same effect by using IconTint in the place of
IconAlpha. This is preferable as, in general, IconAlpha generates more
redrawing than IconTint.
+
_NoShape_ removes the shape mask from the colorset while _Plain_
removes the background pixmap or gradient.
+
Examples
+
....
Colorset 3 fg tan, bg navy
....
+
If necessary this creates colorsets 0, 1, 2 and 3 and then changes
colorset 3 to have a foreground of tan, a background of navy.
+
....
Colorset 3 bg "navy blue"
....
+
changes the background color of colorset 3 to navy blue. The
foreground and pixmap are unchanged.
+
....
Colorset 3 AspectPixmap large_murky_dungeon.xpm
....
+
causes depression.
+
....
Colorset 3 bg Average
....
+
Sets the background color and the relief colors to match the
background pixmap. This is the default setting but it must be used if
a background color was specified and is now not required.
+
....
Colorset 3 YGradient 200 3 blue 1000 navy 1 blue 1000 navy
....
+
Adds a Yin Yang gradient background pixmap to colorset 3. If the
background is set to average it is recomputed along with the
foreground if that is set to contrast.

	FvwmCommand "Colorset 7 fg navy"
	sleep 1
done
....
+
Makes colorset 7 blink.
+
The color names used in colorsets are saved as fvwm variables which
can be substituted in any fvwm command. For example:
+
....
AddToFunc InitFunction
+ I Exec exec xterm -fg $[fg.cs0] -bg $[bg.cs0]
....
+
Where $[fg.cs0] is the foreground color of colorset zero. Please refer
to the *Command Expansion* section for more information.

*CleanupColorsets*::
	Resets a definition of all colorsets.

*Color Gradients*::
	A color gradient is a background that changes its color gradually from
	one hue to a different one. Color gradients can be used by various
	commands and modules of fvwm. There are eight types of gradients:
	*HGradient* is a horizontal gradient, *VGradient* is vertical,
	*DGradient* is diagonal from top left to bottom right, *BGradient* is
	backwards diagonal from bottom left to top right, *SGradient* is
	concentric squares, *CGradient* is concentric circles, *RGradient* is
	a radar like pattern and *YGradient* is a Yin Yang style (but without
	the dots).
+
The color gradient syntax has two forms:
+
*?Gradient* _colors_ _start-color_ _end-color_
+
This form specifies a linear gradient. The arguments denote the total
number of _colors_ to allocate (between 2 and 1000), the initial color
and the final color.
+
Example:
+

....
TitleStyle VGradient 20 rgb:b8/ce/bc rgb:5b/85/d0
....

+
*?Gradient* _colors_ _segments_ _color_ _length_ _color_ [_length_
_color_] ...
+
The second form specifies a nonlinear gradient. The arguments are: the
total number of _colors_ to allocate (between 2 and 1000), then the
number of _segments_. For each segment, specify the starting _color_,
a relative _length_, then the ending color. Each subsequent segment
begins with the second color of the last segment. The lengths may be
any non-negative integers. The length of one segment divided by the
sum of all segments lengths is the fraction of the colors that are
used for the segment.
+
Examples:
+

....
Colorset 0 DGradient 128 2 lightgrey 50 blue 50 white

# 20% gradient from red to blue,
# 30% from blue to black,
# 50% from black to grey
Colorset 0 DGradient 100 3 Red 20 Blue 30 Black 50 Grey

# 50% from blue to green, then
# 50% from yellow to red
Colorset 0 HGradient 128 3 Blue 1000 Green 1 Yellow 1000 Red
....
+
Note: Some gradient styles may be slow and consume huge amounts of
memory, so if you encounter performance problems with them you may be
better off by not using them. To improve performance you can try one
or all of the following:
+
Turn hilighting of the active menu item other than foreground color
off:
+
....
MenuStyle <style> Hilight3DOff, !HilightBack
....
+
Make sure sub menus do not overlap the parent menu. This can prevent
menus being redrawn every time a sub menu pops up or down.
+
....
MenuStyle <style> PopupOffset 1 100
....
+
Run your X server with backing storage. If your X Server is started
with the -bs option, turn it off. If not try the -wm and +bs options:
+
....
startx -- -wm +bs
....
+
You may have to adapt this example to your system (e.g. if you use
xinit to start X).

== ENVIRONMENT

The environment variables that have an effect on how fvwm operates are
the following:

_DISPLAY_::
	Fvwm starts on this display unless the *-display* option is given.

_FVWM_USERDIR_::
	Used to determine the user's data directory for reading and writing
	files. If this variable is not already set, it is set by fvwm to
	_$HOME/.fvwm_, which is the default user's data directory.

_FVWM3_LOGFILE_::
	Used to determine the path and filename to log debug information from
	fvwm3. By default debug log is written to
	_$FVWM_USERDIR_/fvwm3-output.log . If an absolute path is specified
	(starting with /) then _$FVWM_USERDIR_ is ignored, otherwise the log is
	written to _$FVWM_USERDIR_/_$FVWM3_LOGFILE_ .

_FVWM_DATADIR_::
	Set by fvwm to the directory containing fvwm config and module data.

_FVWM_MODULEDIR_::
	Set by fvwm to the directory containing the standard fvwm modules.

_SESSION_MANAGER_::
	Fvwm tries to contact this session manager.

_SESSION_MANAGER_NAME_::
	This is used mainly to determine xsm running to work around its bug. If
	this variable is set to "xsm", DiscardCommand is set as xsm expects it
	and not as XSMP requires. If you run fvwm under xsm, you should set this
	variable to "xsm", otherwise old state files are not removed.

_SM_SAVE_DIR_::
	If this is set, fvwm saves its session data in this directory. Otherwise
	it uses _$HOME_. Note, the state files are named _.fs-??????_ and
	normally are removed automatically when not used anymore.
