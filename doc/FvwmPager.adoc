== NAME

FvwmPager - The fvwm pager module

== SYNOPSIS

*FvwmPager* [ _-transient_ ] [ _alias_ ] [ _first desk_ [ _last desk_ ] ]

FvwmPager is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

FvwmPager displays a miniature view of the fvwm virtual desktop(s) showing
all desk numbers between _first desk_ and _last desk_. If _last desk_ is
omitted only the _first desk_ is shown. If both desk numbers are omitted,
the current desk is used instead. If you use an asterisk '*' in place of
_first desk_ the pager will always show the current desktop, even when you
switch desks. If you iconify FvwmPager, its icon on the virtual desktop
will be a functional version of the pager only showing the current desktop.

FvwmPager is launched via the `Module FvwmPager` command from fvwm's config
file, and can be launched from functions, menus, key bindings, and so on. If
the pager is started with the _-transient_ option, the next time a button is
released the pager is closed. Note that this option only works if the window
style of the pager window is 'Sticky' (see the fvwm man page). You should use
the 'StaysOnTop' style too.

The following example shows how to launch two pagers from your config file
when fvwm starts. The first is a pager which will show all desks from 0 to
3, and the second is a pager which only shows the current desk.

....
AddToFunc StartFunction Module FvwmPager 0 3
AddToFunc StartFunction Module FvwmPager *
....

FvwmPager is configured via an fvwm module configuration alias. If an _alias_
is given, FvwmPager will use the _alias_ for the configuration and name of the
window. If no _alias_ is given, the default 'FvwmPager' alias is used. See the
*CONFIGURATION* section below for a full list of configuration options.

== DESCRIPTION

FvwmPager displays a miniature view of the fvwm virtual desktop(s) showing
the position of all windows and pages within each visible desktop. If
_DeskHilight_ is set, the location of each monitor within the
desktop is also shown. The pager can be used as a quick reference of the
location of windows and monitors, to change the current page/desk, and to
focus or move windows.

When left clicked, FvwmPager will move the current desk/page to the location
clicked. If 'DesktopConfiguration' is set to 'global' all monitors will move
to the location you clicked, while if 'DesktopConfiguration' is set to
'per-monitor', then only the monitor which occupies the area
clicked is moved. This allows individual control of what each monitor is
viewing. Note, when using 'per-monitor' mode, only clicks in areas occupied
by a monitor will move it (ignoring clicks in dead space or desktop titles),
while in 'global' mode (or showing a single monitor), clicks in dead space
and desktop titles will move all monitors to the corresponding page/desk.
Also note, if using 'shared' mode, it is best to run one pager per 'Monitor',
as the pager will not function correctly otherwise.

When right clicked, FvwmPager will move the current view port centered on
the area you clicked. Unlike a left click, which always places the monitor(s)
inside a single page's boundaries, left click will 'Scroll' between multiple
pages. While right click is held down, moving the mouse will cause the view
port to 'Scroll' to the mouse location. Note that 'Scroll' works best in
'global' mode.

If you middle click on a window in the pager, that window will gain focus.
Setting the _*FvwmPager: SloppyFocus_ option will give focus to the window
under the mouse. Holding down middle click on a window in the pager can be
used the move the window. The window can be placed at any location inside
the pager, and when you move the window outside of the pager, the window
will move to the mouses current location, and can continued to be moved to
any location inside your screen.

When iconified, FvwmPager's icon on the desktop is a fully functional pager
that only shows the current desk. This icon pager responds to all the same
clicks as described above. This is useful by allowing full pager that shows
multiple virtual desktops to be iconified to a smaller pager that only shows
the current desk. Note that the FvwmPager icon must be visible via
'Style FvwmPager Icon', and not overridden, for this to work.

FvwmPager will compute its initial window size based on your monitor(s)
configuration. By default it makes a pager 1/32 the size of your monitor(s)
resolution (see _DeskTopScale_) and matches either the global
aspect ratio or a single monitor if _Monitor_ is set. Both the size of
the pager (see _Geometry_) and desktop layout (see _Cols_ and _Rows_)
can be configured.

== CONFIGURATION

FvwmPager is configured via a module configuration alias in fvwm's
configuration file. The default alias is 'FvwmPager' and can be configured
using lines of the form:

....
*FvwmPager: Option parameters
....

When FvwmPager is launched with an optional _alias_, that _alias_ will
be used for the configuration instead. For example to start a pager that
shows the current desk on a single monitor, use the following:

....
DestroyModuleConfig FvwmPagerDP2:*
*FvwmPagerDP2: Monitor DP-2
*FvwmPagerDP2: Font None
*FvwmPagerDP2: MiniIcons
AddToFunc StartFunction Module FvwmPager FvwmPagerDP2 *
....

The full list of configuration options and their parameters
are listed below.

== CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

*FvwmPager: Geometry geometry::
  Completely or partially specifies the pager windows location and
  geometry, in standard X11 notation. If both width and height are
  set, FvwmPager will use that size and no longer preserve the
  aspect ratio when resized. If you wish to maintain an undistorted
  aspect ratio, you can set one dimension to zero. For example
  '400x0' will make a 400 pixel wide window whose height matches
  the aspect ratio and will also preserve aspect ratio when resized.
+
*Note*: FvwmPager's dimensions will be slightly adjusted to ensure
every page shown has the exact same number of pixels. So the actual
size may be slightly different than the specified size.

*FvwmPager: Rows rows::
  Tells fvwm how many rows of desks to use when laying out the pager
  window.

*FvwmPager: Columns columns::
  Tells fvwm how many columns of desks to use when laying out the pager
  window.

*FvwmPager: IconGeometry geometry::
  Specifies a size (optional) and location (optional) for the pager's
  icon window. Since there is no easy way for FvwmPager to determine the
  height of the icon's label, you will have to make an allowance for the
  icon label height when using negative y-coordinates in the icon
  location specification (used to specify a location relative to the
  bottom instead of the top of the screen).

*FvwmPager: StartIconic::
  Causes the pager to start iconified.

*FvwmPager: NoStartIconic::
  Causes the pager to start normally. Useful for canceling the effect of
  the _StartIconic_ option.

*FvwmPager: LabelsBelow::
  Causes the pager to draw desk labels below the corresponding desk.

*FvwmPager: LabelsAbove::
  Causes the pager to draw desk labels above the corresponding desk.
  Useful for canceling the effect of the _LabelsBelow_ option.

*FvwmPager: ShapeLabels::
  Causes the pager to hide the labels of all but the current desk. This
  turns off label hilighting.

*FvwmPager: NoShapeLabels::
  Causes the pager to show the labels of all visible desks. Useful for
  canceling the effect of the _ShapeLabels_ option.

*FvwmPager: Font font-name::
  Specified a font to use to label the desktops. If _font_name_ is
  "none" then no desktop labels will be displayed.

*FvwmPager: SmallFont font-name::
  Specified a font to use to label the window names in the pager. If not
  specified, the window labels will be omitted. Window labels seem to be
  fairly useless for desktop scales of 32 or greater. If _font_name_ is
  "none" then no window names will be displayed.

*FvwmPager: Fore color::
  Specifies the color to use to write the desktop labels, and to draw
  the page-grid lines.

*FvwmPager: Back color::
  Specifies the background color for the window.

*FvwmPager: Hilight color::
  The active page and desk label will be highlighted by using this
  background pattern instead of the normal background.

*FvwmPager: HilightPixmap pixmap::
  The active page will be highlighted by using this background pattern
  instead of the normal background.

*FvwmPager: DeskHilight::
  Hilight the area shown by all active monitors with the current hilight
  color/pixmap. Useful for canceling the effect of the _NoDeskHilight_ option.

*FvwmPager: NoDeskHilight::
  Don't hilight the active page.

*FvwmPager: WindowColors fore back hiFore hiBack::
  Change the normal/highlight colors of the windows. _fore_ and _hiFore_
  specify the colors as used for the font inside the windows. _back_ and
  _hiBack_ are used to fill the windows with.

*FvwmPager: WindowLabelFormat format::
  This specifies a printf() like format for the labels in the mini
  window. Possible flags are: %t, %i, %c, and %r for the window's title,
  icon title, class, or resource name, respectively. The default is
  "%i".

*FvwmPager: DeskColor desk color::
  Assigns the color _color_ to desk _desk_ (or the current desk if desk
  is "*") in the pager window. This replaces the background color for
  the particular _desk_. This only works when the pager is full sized.
  When Iconified, the pager uses the color specified by *FvwmPager:
  Back.

*FvwmPager: Pixmap pixmap::
  Use _pixmap_ as background for the pager.

*FvwmPager: DeskPixmap desk pixmap::
  Assigns the pixmap _color_ to desk _desk_ (or the current desk if desk
  is "*") in the pager window. This replaces the background pixmap for
  the particular _desk_.

*FvwmPager: DeskTopScale number::
  If the geometry is not specified, then a desktop reduction factor is
  used to calculate the pager's size. Things in the pager window are
  shown at 1/_number_ of the actual size.

*FvwmPager: MiniIcons::
  Allow the pager to display a window's mini icon in the pager, if it
  has one, instead of showing the window's name.

*FvwmPager: MoveThreshold pixels::
  Defines the distance the pointer has to be moved before a window being
  dragged with button 2 is actually moved. The default value is three
  pixels. If the pointer moved less that this amount the window snaps
  back to its original position when the button is released. If _pixels_
  is less than zero the default value is used. The value set with the
  _MoveThreshold_ command in fvwm is inherited by FvwmPager but can be
  overridden with this option.

*FvwmPager: SloppyFocus::
  If the SloppyFocus option is used, you do not need to click into the
  mini window in the pager to give the real window the focus. Simply
  putting the pointer over the window inside the pager is enough.
+
Note: This option interferes slightly with the MouseFocus and
SloppyFocus styles of fvwm. Sometimes, if you click into the pager
window to change pages or desks and then move the pointer to a place on
the screen where a window of the new page will appear, this new window
does not get the input focus. This may happen if you drag the pointer
over one of the mini windows in the pager. There is nothing that can be
done about this - except not using SloppyFocus in the pager.

*FvwmPager: SolidSeparators::
  By default the pages of the virtual desktop are separated by dashed
  lines in the pager window. This option causes FvwmPager to use solid
  lines instead.

*FvwmPager: NoSeparators::
  Turns off the lines separating the pages of the virtual desktop.

*FvwmPager: Balloons [type]::
  Show a balloon describing the window when the pointer is moved into a
  window in the pager. The default format (the window's icon name) can
  be changed using BalloonStringFormat. If _type_ is _Pager_ balloons
  are just shown for an un-iconified pager; if _type_ is _Icon_ balloons
  are just shown for an iconified pager. If _type_ is anything else (or
  null) balloons are always shown.

*FvwmPager: BalloonFore color::
  Specifies the color for text in the balloon window. If omitted it
  defaults to the foreground color for the window being described.

*FvwmPager: BalloonBack color::
  Specifies the background color for the balloon window. If omitted it
  defaults to the background color for the window being described.

*FvwmPager: BalloonFont font-name::
  Specifies a font to use for the balloon text. Defaults to _fixed_.

*FvwmPager: BalloonBorderWidth number::
  Sets the width of the balloon window's border. Defaults to 1.

*FvwmPager: BalloonBorderColor color::
  Sets the color of the balloon window's border. Defaults to black.

*FvwmPager: BalloonYOffset number::
  The balloon window is positioned to be horizontally centered against
  the pager window it is describing. The vertical position may be set as
  an offset. Negative offsets of _-n_ are placed _n_ pixels above the
  pager window, positive offsets of _+n_ are placed _n_ pixels below.
  Offsets of -1 and 1 represent the balloon window close to the original
  window without a gap. Offsets of 0 are not permitted, as this would
  permit direct transit from pager window to balloon window, causing an
  event loop. Defaults to +3. The offset will change sign automatically,
  as needed, to keep the balloon on the screen.

*FvwmPager: BalloonStringFormat format::
  The same as _*FvwmPager: WindowLabelFormat_, it just specifies the
  string to display in the balloons. The default is "%i".

*FvwmPager: Colorset desk colorset::
  Tells the module to use colorset _colorset_ for _desk_. If you use an
  asterisk '*' in place of _desk_, the colorset is used on all desks.

*FvwmPager: BalloonColorset desk colorset::
  Tells the module to use colorset _colorset_ for balloons on _desk_. If
  you use an asterisk '*' in place of _desk_, the colorset is used on
  all desks.

*FvwmPager: HilightColorset desk colorset::
  Tells the module to use colorset _colorset_ for hilighting on _desk_.
  If you use an asterisk '*' in place of _desk_, the colorset is used on
  all desks.

*FvwmPager: WindowColorsets colorset activecolorset::
  Uses colorsets in the same way as *FvwmPager: WindowColors. The shadow
  and hilight colors of the colorset are only used for the window
  borders if the *FvwmPager: Window3DBorders is specified too.

*FvwmPager: WindowMinSize n::
  Specifies the minimum size as _n_ pixels of the mini windows. This does
  not include the width of the border, so the actual minimum size is
  2 * _WindowBorderWidth_ + _WindowMinSize_. The default is 3.

*FvwmPager: WindowBorderWidth n::
  Specifies the width of the border drawn around the mini windows. This
  also affects the minimum size of the mini windows, which will be
  2 * _WindowBorderWidth_ + _WindowMinSize_. The default is 1.

*FvwmPager: HideSmallWindows::
  Tells FvwmPager to not show windows that are the minimum size. Useful
  for tiny pagers where small windows will appear out of place.

*FvwmPager: Window3DBorders::
  Specifies that the mini windows should have a 3d borders based on the
  mini window background. This option only works if *FvwmPager:
  WindowColorsets is specified.

*FvwmPager: UseSkipList::
  Tells FvwmPager to not show the windows that are using the
  WindowListSkip style.

*FvwmPager: Monitor RandRName::
  Tells FvwmPager to display windows only on _RandRName_ monitor. This
  is especially meaningful when the _DesktopConfiguration_ command is
  set to _per-monitor_.
