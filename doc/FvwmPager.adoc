== NAME

FvwmPager - the Fvwm Pager module

== SYNOPSIS

*FvwmPager* [ _-transient_ ] [ _name_ ] [ _first desk_ [ _last desk_ ] ]
FvwmPager is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

All desks with desk numbers between _first desk_ and _last_ desk are
displayed. If _last desk_ is omitted only the _first desk_ is shown. If
both desk numbers are omitted, the current desk is used instead. If you
use an asterisk '*' in place of _first desk_ the pager will always show
the current desktop, even when you switch desks.

FvwmPager will compute its initial window size based on your monitor(s)
configuration. By default it makes a page 1/32 the size of your monitor(s)
resolution (see _DeskTopScale_) and matches either the global aspect ratio
or a single monitor if _Monitor_ is set. FvwmPager will preserve this
aspect ratio when you resize it. See the _Geometry_ option for more info.

Example lines to put in your .fvwm2rc:

....
Module FvwmPager 0 3
....

or

....
Module FvwmPager *
....

or from within an fvwm pop-up menu:

....
AddToMenu Module-Popup Modules Title
+ Audio        Module FvwmAudio
+ Auto         Module FvwmAuto 200
+ Buttons      Module FvwmButtons
+ Console      Module FvwmConsole
+ Ident        Module FvwmIdent
+ Banner       Module FvwmBanner
+ Pager        Module FvwmPager 0 3
....

or

....
+ Pager        Module FvwmPager *
....

If the pager is started with the _-transient_ option, the next time a
button is released the pager is closed. Note that this option does only
work if the window style of the pager window is 'sticky' (see the fvwm
man page). You should use the 'StaysOnTop' style too.

Example:

....
Style FvwmPager Sticky, StaysOnTop
*FvwmPager: Rows       1
*FvwmPager: Columns    1
Mouse 3 R C Module FvwmPager -transient
....

With this in your .fvwm2rc, if you press control and button 3 in the
root window the pager pops up under the mouse and while the viewport
moves with the mouse.

== DESCRIPTION

The FvwmPager module shows a miniature view of the Fvwm desktops which
are specified in the command line. This is a useful reminder of where
your active windows are. Windows in the pager are shown in the same
color as their fvwm decorations.

The pager can be used to change your viewport into the current desktop,
to change desktops, or to move windows around.

Pressing mouse button 1 in the pager will cause you viewport to change
to the selected page of the selected desk. If you click with button 1 in
the desk-label area, you will switch desks but not pages within the
desk.

Dragging mouse button 2 on a miniature view of a window will cause that
window to be move to the location where you release the mouse button,
but your viewport will not change. If you drag the window out of the
pager and onto your desktop, a full size image of the window will appear
for you to place. There is no way to pick up a full size image of the
window and move it into the pager, however. Since some mice do not have
button 2, I have made provisions to drag windows in the pager by using
pressing modifier-1 (usually Alt) and dragging with button 3.

Clicking mouse button 3 on a location will cause the viewport to move to
the selected location and switch desks if necessary, but will not align
the viewport to a page boundary. Dragging button 3 will cause the
viewport to move as you drag but not switch desktops, even if the
pointer moves to another desktop.

With the _*FvwmPager: SloppyFocus_ option the focus is transferred to
the window pointed at with the mouse when the pointer is inside the
pager.

When iconified, the pager will work as a fully functional current desk
only pager. Windows and viewports can be moved within the icon of the
pager. Users will want to make sure that they have no lines similar to

....
Icon "Fvwm Pager" whatever
....

in their .fvwm2rc files.

== INITIALIZATION

During initialization, _FvwmPager_ gets config info from *fvwm*'s module
configuration database (see _fvwm_(1), section *MODULE COMMANDS*).

To use FvwmPager with several different configurations, you can invoke
FvwmPager with an optional parameter, which it will use as its _name_
instead (e.g "Module FvwmPager OtherPager"). OtherPager will then read
only the lines in the configuration file starting with "*OtherPager",
and not the lines belonging to FvwmPager. This way multiple pager
instances may be used.

Note: the old way to use the FvwmPager with several different
configurations is to link the executable to another name, i.e.

....
ln -s FvwmPager OtherPager
....

This may work, but this method is not supported.

== KEYBOARD FOCUS CONTROL

You can direct the keyboard focus to any window on the current desktop
by clicking with button 2 on its image in the pager. The window does not
need to be visible, but it does need to be on the current page.

== INVOCATION

The invocation method was shown in the synopsis section

== CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

*FvwmPager: Geometry geometry::
  Completely or partially specifies the pager windows location and
  geometry, in standard X11 notation. If both width and height are
  set, FvwmPager will use that size and no longer preserve the
  aspect ratio when resized. If you wish to maintain an undistorted
  aspect ratio, you can set one dimension to zero. For example
  '400x0' will make a 400 pixel wide window whose height matches
  the aspect ratio and will also preserve aspect ratio when resized.
+
*Note*: FvwmPager's dimensions will be slightly adjusted to ensure
every page shown has the exact same number of pixels. So the actual
size may be slightly different than the specified size.
*FvwmPager: Rows rows::
  Tells fvwm how many rows of desks to use when laying out the pager
  window.
*FvwmPager: Columns columns::
  Tells fvwm how many columns of desks to use when laying out the pager
  window.
*FvwmPager: IconGeometry geometry::
  Specifies a size (optional) and location (optional) for the pager's
  icon window. Since there is no easy way for FvwmPager to determine the
  height of the icon's label, you will have to make an allowance for the
  icon label height when using negative y-coordinates in the icon
  location specification (used to specify a location relative to the
  bottom instead of the top of the screen).
*FvwmPager: StartIconic::
  Causes the pager to start iconified.
*FvwmPager: NoStartIconic::
  Causes the pager to start normally. Useful for canceling the effect of
  the _StartIconic_ option.
*FvwmPager: LabelsBelow::
  Causes the pager to draw desk labels below the corresponding desk.
*FvwmPager: LabelsAbove::
  Causes the pager to draw desk labels above the corresponding desk.
  Useful for canceling the effect of the _LabelsBelow_ option.
*FvwmPager: ShapeLabels::
  Causes the pager to hide the labels of all but the current desk. This
  turns off label hilighting.
*FvwmPager: NoShapeLabels::
  Causes the pager to show the labels of all visible desks. Useful for
  canceling the effect of the _ShapeLabels_ option.
*FvwmPager: Font font-name::
  Specified a font to use to label the desktops. If _font_name_ is
  "none" then no desktop labels will be displayed.
*FvwmPager: SmallFont font-name::
  Specified a font to use to label the window names in the pager. If not
  specified, the window labels will be omitted. Window labels seem to be
  fairly useless for desktop scales of 32 or greater. If _font_name_ is
  "none" then no window names will be displayed.
*FvwmPager: Fore color::
  Specifies the color to use to write the desktop labels, and to draw
  the page-grid lines.
*FvwmPager: Back color::
  Specifies the background color for the window.
*FvwmPager: Hilight color::
  The active page and desk label will be highlighted by using this
  background pattern instead of the normal background.
*FvwmPager: HilightPixmap pixmap::
  The active page will be highlighted by using this background pattern
  instead of the normal background.
*FvwmPager: DeskHilight::
  Hilight the active page with the current hilight color/pixmap. Useful
  for canceling the effect of the _NoDeskHilight_ option.
*FvwmPager: NoDeskHilight::
  Don't hilight the active page.
*FvwmPager: WindowColors fore back hiFore hiBack::
  Change the normal/highlight colors of the windows. _fore_ and _hiFore_
  specify the colors as used for the font inside the windows. _back_ and
  _hiBack_ are used to fill the windows with.
*FvwmPager: WindowLabelFormat format::
  This specifies a printf() like format for the labels in the mini
  window. Possible flags are: %t, %i, %c, and %r for the window's title,
  icon title, class, or resource name, respectively. The default is
  "%i".
*FvwmPager: DeskColor desk color::
  Assigns the color _color_ to desk _desk_ (or the current desk if desk
  is "*") in the pager window. This replaces the background color for
  the particular _desk_. This only works when the pager is full sized.
  When Iconified, the pager uses the color specified by *FvwmPager:
  Back.
+


*FvwmPager: Pixmap pixmap::
  Use _pixmap_ as background for the pager.
*FvwmPager: DeskPixmap desk pixmap::
  Assigns the pixmap _color_ to desk _desk_ (or the current desk if desk
  is "*") in the pager window. This replaces the background pixmap for
  the particular _desk_.
+

*FvwmPager: DeskTopScale number::
  If the geometry is not specified, then a desktop reduction factor is
  used to calculate the pager's size. Things in the pager window are
  shown at 1/_number_ of the actual size.
*FvwmPager: MiniIcons::
  Allow the pager to display a window's mini icon in the pager, if it
  has one, instead of showing the window's name.
*FvwmPager: MoveThreshold pixels::
  Defines the distance the pointer has to be moved before a window being
  dragged with button 2 is actually moved. The default value is three
  pixels. If the pointer moved less that this amount the window snaps
  back to its original position when the button is released. If _pixels_
  is less than zero the default value is used. The value set with the
  _MoveThreshold_ command in fvwm is inherited by FvwmPager but can be
  overridden with this option.
*FvwmPager: SloppyFocus::
  If the SloppyFocus option is used, you do not need to click into the
  mini window in the pager to give the real window the focus. Simply
  putting the pointer over the window inside the pager is enough.
+
Note: This option interferes slightly with the MouseFocus and
SloppyFocus styles of fvwm. Sometimes, if you click into the pager
window to change pages or desks and then move the pointer to a place on
the screen where a window of the new page will appear, this new window
does not get the input focus. This may happen if you drag the pointer
over one of the mini windows in the pager. There is nothing that can be
done about this - except not using SloppyFocus in the pager.

*FvwmPager: SolidSeparators::
  By default the pages of the virtual desktop are separated by dashed
  lines in the pager window. This option causes FvwmPager to use solid
  lines instead.
*FvwmPager: NoSeparators::
  Turns off the lines separating the pages of the virtual desktop.
*FvwmPager: Balloons [type]::
  Show a balloon describing the window when the pointer is moved into a
  window in the pager. The default format (the window's icon name) can
  be changed using BalloonStringFormat. If _type_ is _Pager_ balloons
  are just shown for an un-iconified pager; if _type_ is _Icon_ balloons
  are just shown for an iconified pager. If _type_ is anything else (or
  null) balloons are always shown.
*FvwmPager: BalloonFore color::
  Specifies the color for text in the balloon window. If omitted it
  defaults to the foreground color for the window being described.
*FvwmPager: BalloonBack color::
  Specifies the background color for the balloon window. If omitted it
  defaults to the background color for the window being described.
*FvwmPager: BalloonFont font-name::
  Specifies a font to use for the balloon text. Defaults to _fixed_.
*FvwmPager: BalloonBorderWidth number::
  Sets the width of the balloon window's border. Defaults to 1.
*FvwmPager: BalloonBorderColor color::
  Sets the color of the balloon window's border. Defaults to black.
*FvwmPager: BalloonYOffset number::
  The balloon window is positioned to be horizontally centered against
  the pager window it is describing. The vertical position may be set as
  an offset. Negative offsets of _-n_ are placed _n_ pixels above the
  pager window, positive offsets of _+n_ are placed _n_ pixels below.
  Offsets of -1 and 1 represent the balloon window close to the original
  window without a gap. Offsets of 0 are not permitted, as this would
  permit direct transit from pager window to balloon window, causing an
  event loop. Defaults to +3. The offset will change sign automatically,
  as needed, to keep the balloon on the screen.
*FvwmPager: BalloonStringFormat format::
  The same as _*FvwmPager: WindowLabelFormat_, it just specifies the
  string to display in the balloons. The default is "%i".
*FvwmPager: Colorset desk colorset::
  Tells the module to use colorset _colorset_ for _desk_. If you use an
  asterisk '*' in place of _desk_, the colorset is used on all desks.
*FvwmPager: BalloonColorset desk colorset::
  Tells the module to use colorset _colorset_ for balloons on _desk_. If
  you use an asterisk '*' in place of _desk_, the colorset is used on
  all desks.
*FvwmPager: HilightColorset desk colorset::
  Tells the module to use colorset _colorset_ for hilighting on _desk_.
  If you use an asterisk '*' in place of _desk_, the colorset is used on
  all desks.
*FvwmPager: WindowColorsets colorset activecolorset::
  Uses colorsets in the same way as *FvwmPager: WindowColors. The shadow
  and hilight colors of the colorset are only used for the window
  borders if the *FvwmPager: Window3DBorders is specified too.
*FvwmPager: WindowMinSize n::
  Specifies the minimum size as _n_ pixels of the mini windows. This does
  not include the width of the border, so the actual minimum size is
  2 * _WindowBorderWidth_ + _WindowMinSize_. The default is 3.
*FvwmPager: WindowBorderWidth n::
  Specifies the width of the border drawn around the mini windows. This
  also affects the minimum size of the mini windows, which will be
  2 * _WindowBorderWidth_ + _WindowMinSize_. The default is 1.
*FvwmPager: HideSmallWindows::
  Tells FvwmPager to not show windows that are the minimum size. Useful
  for tiny pagers where small windows will appear out of place.
*FvwmPager: Window3DBorders::
  Specifies that the mini windows should have a 3d borders based on the
  mini window background. This option only works if *FvwmPager:
  WindowColorsets is specified.
*FvwmPager: UseSkipList::
  Tells FvwmPager to not show the windows that are using the
  WindowListSkip style.
*FvwmPager: Monitor RandRName::
  Tells FvwmPager to display windows only on _RandRName_ monitor. This
  is especially meaningful when the _DesktopConfiguration_ command is
  set to _per-monitor_.
