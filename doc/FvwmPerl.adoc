= FvwmPerl(1)

== NAME

FvwmPerl - the fvwm perl manipulator and preprocessor

== SYNOPSIS

FvwmPerl should be spawned by _fvwm_â€†(1) for normal functionality.

To run this module, place the command `Module FvwmPerl [params]` in fvwm's
configuration file to start sending commands to FvwmPerl.

== DESCRIPTION

This module is intended to extend fvwm commands with the perl scripting
power. It enables to embed perl expressions in the fvwm config files and
construct fvwm commands.

== INVOCATION

If you want to invoke the unique and persistent instanse of FvwmPerl, it
is suggested to do this from the _StartFunction_. Calling it from the
top is also possible, but involves some issues not discussed here.

AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmPerl

There are several command line switches:

*FvwmPerl* [ *--eval* line ] [ *--load* file ] [ *--preprocess* [
*--quote* char ] [ *--winid* wid ] [ *--cmd* ] [ *--nosend* ] [
*--noremove* ] [ line | file ] ] [ *--export* [names] ] [ *--stay* ] [
*--nolock* ] [ alias ]

Long switches may be abbreviated to short one-letter switches.

**-e**|*--eval* _line_::
	evaluate the given perl code

**-l**|*--load* _file_::
	evaluate perl code in the given file

**-p**|*--preprocess* [ _file_ ]::
	preprocess the given fvwm config file
+
The following 5 options are only valid together with *--preprocess*
option.
+
--
**-c**|*--cmd* _line_::
	An fvwm command to be preprocessed instead of file.

**-q**|*--quote* _char_::
	Change the default '%' quote.

**-w**|*--winid* _wid_::
	Set explicit window context (should begin with
	digit, may be in oct or hex form; this window id overwrites implicit
	window context if any).

*--nosend*::
	Do not send the preprocessed file to _fvwm_ for **Read**ing, the
	default is send. Useful for preprocessing non fvwm config files.

*--noremove*::
	Do not remove the preprocessed file after sending it to
	_fvwm_ for **Read**ing, the default is remove. Useful for debugging.
--
**-x**|*--export* [_names_]::
	Define fvwm shortcut functions (by default,
	two functions named Eval and .). This option implies *--stay*.

**-s**|*--stay*::
	Continues an execution after *--eval*, *--load* or
	*--preprocess* are processed. By default, the module is not persistent
	in this case, i.e. *--nostay* is assumed.

*--nolock*::
	When one of the 3 action options is given, this option
	causes unlocking _fvwm_ immediately. By default the requested action
	is executed synchronously; this only makes difference when invoked
	like:
+
....
ModuleSynchronous FvwmPerl --preprocess someconfig.ppp
....
+
If *--nolock* is added here, *ModuleSynchronous* returns immediately.
Note that *Module* returns immediately regardless of this option.

== USING ALIAS

Aliases allow one to have several module invocations and work separately
with all invocations, here is an example:

....
ModuleSynchronous FvwmPerl FvwmPerl-JustTest
SendToModule FvwmPerl-JustTest eval $a = 2 + 2; $b = $a SendToModule
FvwmPerl-JustTest eval cmd("Echo 2 + 2 = $b")
KillModule FvwmPerl FvwmPerl-JustTest
....

== PREPROCESSING EXAMPLE

One of the effective proprocessing solutions is to pass the whole fvwm
configuration with embedded perl code to FvwmPerl --preprocess. An
alternative approach is to write a perl script that produces fvwm
commands and sends them for execution, this script may be loaded using
FvwmPerl --load. There are however intermediate solutions that
preprocess only separate configuration lines (or alternatively, execute
separate perl commands that produce fvwm commands).

The following code snippet adds ability of arithmetics and string
scripting to certain lines that need this. To use this, you want to
start FvwmPerl as your first command so that other commands may be asked
to be preprosessed.

....

. GotoDesk 0 %{ $[desk.n] + 1 }%         # go to next desk

# center a window

. Exec exec xmessage %{2 + 2}%           # simple calculator

. %{main::show_message(2 + 2, "Yet another Calculator"); ""}%
....

== ACTIONS

There are several actions that FvwmPerl may perform:

eval perl-code::

Evaluate a line of perl code. A special function **cmd(**command*)* may
be used in perl code to send commands back to fvwm. If perl code
contains an error, it is printed to the standard error stream with the
_[FvwmPerl][eval]:_ header prepended.

load file-name::

Load a file of perl code. If the file is not fully qualified, it is
searched in the user directory `+$FVWM_USERDIR+` (usually ~/.fvwm) and
the system wide data directory `+$FVWM_DATADIR+`. A special function
**cmd(**command*)* may be used in perl code to send commands back to
fvwm. If perl code contains an error, it is printed to the standard
error stream with the _[FvwmPerl][load]:_ header prepended.

preprocess [-q|--quote char] [-c|--cmd] [line | file]::

Preprocess fvwm config _file_ or (if --cmd is given) _line_. This file
contains lines that are not touched (usually fvwm commands) and
specially preformatted perl code that is processed and replaced. Text
enclosed in *%\{* ... *}%* delimiters, that may start anywhere on the
line and end anywhere on the same or another line, is perl code. The
_quote_ parameter changes perl code delimiters. If a single char is
given, like '@', the delimiters are *@\{* ... *}@*. If the given quote
is 2 chars, like *<>*, the quotes are *<\{* ... *}>* The perl code is
substituted for the result of its evaluation. I.e. %\{$a = c; ++$a}% is
replaced with d. The evaluation is unlike *eval* and *load* is done
under the package PreprocessNamespace and without _use strict_, so you
are free to use any variable names without fear of conflicts. Just don't
use uninitialized variables to mean undef or empty list (they may be in
fact initialized by the previous preprocess action), and do a clean-up
if needed. The variables and function in the _main_ package are still
available, like ::_cmd()_ or ::_skip()_, but it is just not a good idea
to access them while preprocessing. There is a special function
*include*(_file_) that loads a file, preprocesses it and returns the
preprocessed result. Avoid recursion. If any embedded perl code contains
an error, it is printed to the standard error stream and prepended with
the _[FvwmPerl][preprocess]:_ header. The result of substitution is
empty in this case. The following variables may be used in the perl
code: `+$USER+`, `+$DISPLAY+`, `+$WIDTH+`, `+$HEIGHT+`,
`+$FVWM_VERSION+`, `+$FVWM_MODULEDIR+`, `+$FVWM_DATADIR+`,
`+$FVWM_USERDIR+` The following line based directives are recognized
when preprocessing. They are processed after the perl code (if any) is
substituted.

%Repeat count::

Causes the following lines to be repeated _count_ times.

%ModuleConfig module-name [ destroy ]::

Causes the following lines to be interpreted as the given module
configuration. If destroy is specified the previous module configuration
is destroyed first.

%Prefix prefix::

Prefixes the following lines with the quoted _prefix_.

%End any-optional-comment::

Ends any of the directives described above, may be nested.
+
....
%Prefix "AddToFunc SwitchToWindow I"
    Iconify off
    WindowShade off
    Raise
    WarpToWindow 50 50
%End

%ModuleConfig FvwmPager destroy
    Colorset 0
    Font lucidasans-10
    DeskTopScale 28
    MiniIcons
%End ModuleConfig FvwmPager

%Prefix "All (MyWindowToAnimate) ResizeMove "
100 100 %{($WIDTH - 100) / 2}% %{($HEIGHT - 100) / 2}%
%Repeat %{$count}%
br w+2c w+2c w-1c w-1c
%End
%Repeat %{$count}%
br w-2c w-2c w+1c w+1c
%End
%End Prefix
....

export [func-names]::

Send to _fvwm_ the definition of shortcut functions that help to
activate different actions of the module (i.e. *eval*, *load* and
*preprocess*).
+
Function names (_func-names_) may be separated by commas
or/and whitespace. By default, two functions Eval and . are assumed.
+

The actual action defined in a function is guessed from the function name if
possible, where function name . is reserved for *preprocess* action.
+
For example, any of these two fvwm commands
+
....
SendToModule MyPerl export PerlEval,PP
FvwmPerl --export PerlEval,PPMyPerl
....
+
define the following two shortcut functions:
+
....
DestroyFunc PerlEval
AddToFunc I SendToModule MyPerl eval $*
DestroyFunc PP
AddToFunc I SendToModule MyPerl preprocessc-c $*
....
+
These 4 actions may be requested in one of 3 ways: 1) in the command
line when FvwmPerl is invoked (in this case FvwmPerl is short-lived
unless *--stay* or *--export* is also given), 2) by sending the
corresponding message in fvwm config using SendToModule, 3) by calling
the corresponding perl function in perl code.

== FUNCTIONS

There are several functions that perl code may call:

cmd($fvwm_command)::

In case of *eval* or *load* - send back to fvwm a string `+$fvwm_command+`.
In case of *preprocess* - append a string
`+$fvwm_command+` to the output of the embedded perl code.

do_eval($perl_code)::

This function is equivalent to the *eval* functionality on the string
_`+$perl_code+`_, described above.

load($filename)::

This function is equivalent to the *load* functionality on the file
`+$filename+`, described above.

preprocess(@params, ["-c $command"] [$filename])::

This function is equivalent to the *preprocess* functionality with the
given parameters and the file `+$filename+` described above.

export($func_names, [$do_unexport])::

This function is equivalent to the *export* functionality with the given
`+$func_names+`, described above. May also *unexport* the function names
if the second parameter is true. Function names should be separated by
commas or/and whitespace. If _`+$func_names+`_ is empty then functions
Eval and . are assumed.

stop()::

Terminates the module.

skip()::

Skips the rest of the event callback code, i.e. the module returns to
listen to new module events.

unlock()::

Unsynchronizes the event callback from fvwm. This may be useful to
prevent deadlocks, i.e. usually fvwm kills the non-responding module if
the event callback is not finished in _ModuleTimeout_ seconds. This
prevents it. This example causes FvwmPerl to suspend its execution for
one minute: SendModule FvwmPerl eval unlock(); sleep(60); However,
verify that there is no way a new message is sent by fvwm while the
module is busy, and fvwm stays locked on this new message for too long.
See also the *detach* solution if you need long lasting operations.

detach()::

Forks and detaches the rest of the event callback code from the main
process. This may be useful to prevent killing the module if its event
callback should take a long time to complete and it may be done in the
detached child. The detached child may still send commands to fvwm
(don't rely on this), but not receive the events of course, it exits
immediately after the callback execution is finished. If you use
_detach()_, better only send commands to fvwm in one process (the main
one or the detached one), doing otherwise may often cause conflicts.

show_message($msg, $title[, $use_stderr_too=1])::

Shows a dialog window with the given message, using whichever X tool is
found in the system. See *FVWM::Module::Toolkit*::*show_message* for
more information.

== VARIABLES

There are several global variables in the _main_ namespace that may be
used in the perl code:

....
$a, $b, ... $h @a, @b, ... @h %a, %b, ... %h
....

They all are initialized to the empty value and may be used to store a
state between different calls to FvwmPerl actions (*eval* and *load*).

If you need more readable variable names, either write no strict 'vars';
at the start of every perl code or use a hash for this, like:

....
$h{id} = $h{first_name} . " " . $h{second_name}
....

or use a package name, like:

....
@MyMenu::terminals = qw( xterm rxvt );
$MyMenu::item_num = @MyMenu::terminals;
....

There may be a configuration option to turn strictness on and off.

== MESSAGES

FvwmPerl may receive messages using the fvwm command SendToModule. The
names, meanings and parameters of the messages are the same as the
corresponding actions, described above.

Additionally, a message *stop* causes a module to quit.

A message *unexport* [_func-names_] undoes the effect of *export*,
described in the ACTIONS section.

A message *dump* dumps the contents of the changed variables (not yet).

== EXAMPLES

A simple test:

....
SendToModule FvwmPerl eval $h\{dir} = $ENV\{HOME}
SendToModule FvwmPerl eval load($h\{dir} . "/test.fpl")
SendToModule FvwmPerl load $[HOME]/test.fpl
SendToModule FvwmPerl preprocess config.ppp
SendToModule FvwmPerl export Eval,PerlEval,PerlLoad,PerlPP
SendToModulecFvwmPerl unexport PerlEval,PerlLoad,PerlPP
SendToModule FvwmPerl stop
....

The following example handles root backgrounds in fvwmrc. All these
commands may be added to StartFunction.

....
Module FvwmPerl --export PerlEval

# find all background pixmaps for a later use
PerlEval $a = $ENV\{HOME} . "/bg"; \
   opendir DIR, $a; @b = grep \{ /xpm$/ } readdir(DIR); closedir DIR

# build a menu of background pixmaps
AddToMenu MyBackgrounds "My Backgrounds" Title
PerlEval foreach $b (@b) \
   { cmd("AddToMenu MyBackgrounds $b Exec fvwm-root $a/$b") }

# choose a random background to load on start-up
PerlEval cmd("AddToFunc \
    InitFunction + I Exec exec fvwm-root $a/" . $b[int(random(@b))])
....

== ESCAPING

*SendToModule* just like any other fvwm commands expands several dollar
prefixed variables. This may clash with the dollars perl uses. You may
avoid this by prefixing SendToModule with a leading dash. The following
2 lines in each pair are equivalent:

....
SendToModule FvwmPerl eval $$d = "$[DISPLAY]"
-SendToModule FvwmPerl eval $d = "$ENV\{DISPLAY}"
SendToModule FvwmPerl eval \
    cmd("Echo desk=$d, display=$$d")
SendToModule FvwmPerl preprocess -c \
    Echo desk=%("$d")%, display=%\{$$d}%
....

Another solution to avoid escaping of special symbols like dollars and
backslashes is to create a perl file in ~/.fvwm and then load it:

....
SendToModule FvwmPerl load build-menus.fpl
....

If you need to preprocess one command starting with a dash, you should
precede it using "--
2.

....
# this prints the current desk, i.e. "0"
SendToModule FvwmPerl preprocess -c Echo "$%\{$a = "c"; ++$a}%"

# this prints "$d"
SendToModule FvwmPerl preprocess -c -- -Echo "$%\{"d"}%"

# this prints "$d" (SendToModule expands $$ to $)
SendToModule FvwmPerl preprocess -c -- -Echo "$$%\{"d"}%"

# this prints "$$d"
-SendToModule FvwmPerl preprocess -c -- -Echo "$$%\{"d"}%"
....

Again, it is suggested to put your command(s) into file and preprocess
the file instead.

== CAVEATS

FvwmPerl being written in perl and dealing with perl, follows the famous
perl motto: There's more than one way to do it, so the choice is yours.

Here are more pairs of equivalent lines:

....
Module FvwmPerl --load "my.fpl" --stay
Module FvwmPerl -e load("my.fpl") -s

SendToModule FvwmPerl preprocess --quote @ my.pp
SendToModule FvwmPerl eval preprocess(\{quote => @}, "my.ppp");
....

Warning, you may affect the way FvwmPerl works by evaluating appropriate
perl code, this is considered a feature not a bug. But please don't do
this, write your own fvwm module in perl instead.

== SEE ALSO

The _fvwm_â€†(1) man page describes all available commands.

Basically, in your perl code you may use any function or class method
from the perl library installed with fvwm, see the man pages of perl
packages *General::FileSystem*, *General::Parse* and *FVWM::Module*.
