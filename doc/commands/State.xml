<para>Sets, clears or toggles one of the 32 user defined states which
are associated with each window.  The
<emphasis remap='I'>state</emphasis>
is a number ranging from 0 to 31.  The states have no meaning in
fvwm, but they can be checked in conditional commands like
<fvwmref cmd="Next"/>
with the
<emphasis remap='I'>State</emphasis>
condition.  The optional argument
<emphasis remap='I'>bool</emphasis>
is a boolean argument.  "True" sets the given state, while "False"
clears it.  Using "toggle" switches to the opposite state.  If the
<emphasis remap='I'>bool</emphasis>
argument is not given, the state is toggled.</para>
