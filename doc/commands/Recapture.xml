<para>This command is obsolete and should not be used anymore.  Should
you want to do something specific that you cannot do without it,
please report this to the fvwm-workers mailing list
<email>fvwm-workers@fvwm.org</email>.  This command may be removed at some point
in the future.  Please read the note at the end of the section
<fvwmref sect="execution" opt="delayed_execution_of_commands" name="Delayed Execution of Commands"/>
to learn about how to avoid the
<emphasis remap='B'>Recapture</emphasis>
command.</para>

<para>Causes fvwm to recapture all of its windows.  This ensures that
the latest style parameters are used.  The recapture operation is
visually disturbing.</para>

<para>Since fvwm version 2.4 only a very few
<fvwmref cmd="Style"/>
options need a
<emphasis remap='B'>Recapture</emphasis>
to take effect (e.g.
<fvwmref cmd="Style" opt="UseStyle"/>).</para>
