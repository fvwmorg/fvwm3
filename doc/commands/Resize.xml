<para>Allows for resizing a window.  If called from somewhere in a window
or its border, then that window is resized.  If called from the
root window then the user is allowed to select the target window.</para>

<para>The operation can be aborted with Escape or by pressing any mouse
button (except button 1 which confirms it).</para>

<para>If the optional arguments
<emphasis remap='I'>width</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='I'>height</emphasis>
are provided, then the window is resized so that its dimensions
are
<emphasis remap='I'>width</emphasis> by <emphasis remap='I'>height</emphasis>.
The units of
<emphasis remap='I'>width</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='I'>height</emphasis>
are percent-of-screen, unless a letter
'<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="p"/>'
is appended to one or both coordinates, in which case the location
is specified in pixels.  With a
'<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="c"/>'
suffix the unit defined by the client application (hence the c) is
used.  So you can say</para>

<programlisting>Resize 80c 24c</programlisting>

<para>to make a terminal window just big enough for 80x24
characters.</para>

<para>If the
<emphasis remap='I'>width</emphasis> or <emphasis remap='I'>height</emphasis>
is prefixed with the letter
'<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="w"/>'
the size is not taken as an absolute value but added to the
current size of the window.  Example:</para>

<programlisting>
# Enlarge window by one line
Resize keep w+1c
</programlisting>

<para>Both,
<emphasis remap='I'>width</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='I'>height</emphasis>
can be negative.  In this case the new size is the screen size
minus the given value.  If either value is "<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="keep"/>", the
corresponding dimension of the window is left untouched.  The new
size is the size of the client window, thus</para>

<programlisting>Resize 100 100</programlisting>

<para>may make the window bigger than the screen.  To base the new size
on the size of the whole fvwm window, add the
<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="frame"/>
option after the command.  The options
<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="fixeddirection"/>,
<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="direction"/> and
<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="warptoborder"/>
are only used in interactive move operations.  With
<emphasis remap='I'>fixeddirection</emphasis>
the same border is moved even if the pointer moves past the
opposite border.  The
<emphasis remap='I'>direction</emphasis>
option must be followed by a direction name such as "NorthWest",
"South" or "East" (you get the idea).  Resizing is started
immediately, even if the pointer is not on a border.  The
<emphasis remap='I'>warptoborder</emphasis>
option changes the behaviour of the
<emphasis remap='I'>direction</emphasis>
option so that the pointer is automatically warped to the border
in the given direction before starting to resize.  Also, if
resizing is started by clicking on the window border, the pointer
is warped to the outer edge of the border.</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="AddToFunc"/> ResizeSE I Resize <fvwmref cmd="Direction"/> SE
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/> 3 A M ResizeSE
</programlisting>


<para>An alternate syntax is used if the keyword
<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="bottomright"/> or in short
<fvwmopt cmd="Resize" opt="br"/>
follows the command name.  In this case, the arguments
<emphasis remap='I'>x</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='I'>y</emphasis>
specify the desired position of the bottom right corner of the
window.  They are interpreted exactly like the
<emphasis remap='I'>x</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='I'>y</emphasis>
arguments of the
<fvwmref cmd="Move"/>
command.  Actually, any of the options accepted by the
<fvwmref cmd="Move"/>
command can be used.</para>
