	<arg choice='plain'>EWMHNumberOfDesktops num [max]</arg>
</cmdsynopsis>
</command>

<para>This command is useful only for an ewmh compliant pager or taskbar
(as kpager or kicker taskbar) and not for fvwm modules (FvwmPager
or FvwmIconMan). It causes a compliant application to consider at
least
<emphasis remap='I'>num</emphasis>
desktops (desktop 0 to desktop
<emphasis remap='I'>num</emphasis>-1).
The optional argument
<emphasis remap='I'>max</emphasis>
causes a compliant application to never consider more than
<emphasis remap='I'>max</emphasis>
desktops. If
<emphasis remap='I'>max</emphasis>
is 0 (the default) there is no limitation.  The actual number of
desktops is determined dynamically.  It is at least
<emphasis remap='I'>num</emphasis>,
but it can be d if there is a window on desktop d-1 (or if the
current desktop is desktop d-1) and d is less or equal to
<emphasis remap='I'>max</emphasis>
or
<emphasis remap='I'>max</emphasis>
is null.
Moreover, a compliant pager can ask to change
<emphasis remap='I'>num</emphasis>
itself.
This is accepted by fvwm only if this number is
less than or equal to
<emphasis remap='I'>max</emphasis>
or if
<emphasis remap='I'>max</emphasis>
is null.  Note that negative desktops are not supported by the
ewmh specification.  The default is 4 0.</para>
