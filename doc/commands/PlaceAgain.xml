<para>Causes the current window's position to be re-computed using the
initial window placement logic.  The window is moved to where it
would have been if it were a new window that had just appeared.
Most useful with
<emphasis remap='I'>Smart</emphasis> or <emphasis remap='I'>Clever</emphasis> (<emphasis remap='I'>ReallySmart</emphasis>)
placement.  With the optional argument
<fvwmopt cmd="PlaceAgain" opt="Anim"/>
an animated move is used to place the window in its new position.
With the additional option
<fvwmopt cmd="PlaceAgain" opt="Icon"/>,
the icon is placed again instead.</para>
