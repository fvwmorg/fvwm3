</cmdsynopsis>

<para>This command is intended to be used in fvwm functions only.  It
causes execution of a function to pause until a new window matching
<replaceable>window</replaceable>
appears.  This can be a window's name, class, or resource string.
It may contain the wildcards '*' and '?', which are matched in the
usual Unix filename manner.  This is particularly useful in the
"InitFunction" if you are trying to start windows on specific desktops:</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="AddToFunc"/> InitFunction
 + I <fvwmref cmd="Exec"/> exec xterm -geometry 80x64+0+0
 + I Wait xterm
 + I <fvwmref cmd="GotoDesk"/> 0 2
 + I <fvwmref cmd="Exec"/> exec xmh -font fixed -geometry \
       507x750+0+0
 + I Wait xmh
 + I <fvwmref cmd="GotoDesk"/> 0 0
</programlisting>

<para>The above function starts an xterm on the current desk, waits for
it to map itself, then switches to desk 2 and starts an xmh.
After the xmh window appears control moves to desk 0.</para>

<para>Fvwm remains partially functional during a wait, but any input
from the modules is queued up and processed only after the window
appears or the command is aborted.  For example, windows can not
be focused with <fvwmref mod="FvwmIconMan"/> or
<fvwmref mod="FvwmPager"/> during a wait.</para>

<para>You can escape from a
<emphasis remap='B'>Wait</emphasis>
pause by pressing
<keysym>Ctrl-Alt-Escape</keysym>
(where
<keysym>Alt</keysym>
is the first modifier).  To redefine this key sequence see the
<fvwmref cmd="EscapeFunc"/>
command.</para>
