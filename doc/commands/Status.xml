</cmdsynopsis>
	<para>Turns status either On or Off.  This sends information in JSON
		format down a named pipe (set via FVWM_STATUS_PIPE env var)
		about the current desks and number of windows, etc.  This is
		meant to provide a fast means of supplying third-party tools
		information about what's happening in Fvwm.  For example, the
		JSON could be manipulated and sent to tools such as
		<replaceable>lemonbar</replaceable>,
		<replaceable>polybar</replaceable>, etc.
	</para>
	<para>The format of the JSON blob looks like this:</para>
	<programlisting>
	{
	  "version": 1,
	  "current_screen": "HDMI2",
	  "screens": {
	    "HDMI2": {
	      "current_client": "n6tadam@shuttle: ~",
	      "desktops": {
		"0": {
		  "number": 0,
		  "is_urgent": false,
		  "is_current": true,
		  "number_of_clients": 5
	       },
	     },
	   },
	 },
	}
	</programlisting>
	<para>These sections repeat for all screens/groups/etc, depending on
		how many there are of each.
	</para>
