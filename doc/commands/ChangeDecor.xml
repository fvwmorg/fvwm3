<emphasis remap='I'>decor</emphasis>.
<emphasis remap='I'>decor</emphasis>
is "Default" or the name of a decor defined with
<emphasis remap='B'>AddToDecor</emphasis>.

is invalid, nothing occurs.  If called from somewhere in a window
or its border, then that window is affected.  If called from the
root window the user is allowed to select the target window.
<emphasis remap='B'>ChangeDecor</emphasis>
only affects attributes which can be set using the
<emphasis remap='B'>AddToDecor</emphasis>
command.</para>
