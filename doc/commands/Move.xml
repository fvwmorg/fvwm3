<para>Allows the user to move a window.  If called from somewhere in a
window or its border, then that window is moved.  If called from
the root window then the user is allowed to select the target
window.</para>

<para>If the literal option <fvwmopt cmd="Move" opt="screen"/> followed by a
<replaceable>screen</replaceable>
argument is specified, the coordinates are interpreted as relative
to the given screen.  The width and height of the screen are used
for the calculations instead of the display dimensions.  The
<replaceable>screen</replaceable>
as interpreted as in the
<fvwmref cmd="MoveToScreen"/>
command.
If the optional argument
<fvwmopt cmd="Move" opt="Warp"/>
is specified the pointer is warped with the window.  If the single
argument
<fvwmopt cmd="Move" opt="pointer"/>
is given, the top left corner of the window is moved to the
pointer position before starting the operation; this is mainly
intended for internal use by modules like
<fvwmref mod="FvwmPager"/>.</para>

<para>The operation can be aborted with <keysym>Escape</keysym> or any mouse
button not set to place the window. By default mouse button 2 is set to cancel
the move operation. To change this you may use the
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/>
command with special context 'P' for Placement.</para>

<para>The window condition
<fvwmref cmd="Style" opt="PlacedByButton"/>
can be used to check if a specific button was pressed to place the
window (see
<fvwmref cmd="Current"/>
command).</para>

<para>If the optional arguments
<fvwmopt cmd="Move" opt="x"/> and
<fvwmopt cmd="Move" opt="y"/>
are provided, then the window is moved immediately without user
interaction.  Each argument can specify an absolute or relative
position from either the left/top or right/bottom of the screen.
By default, the numeric value given is interpreted as a percentage
of the screen width/height, but a trailing
'<emphasis remap='I'>p</emphasis>'
changes the interpretation to mean pixels, while a trailing
'<emphasis>w</emphasis>'
means precent of the window width/height.
To move the window
relative to its current position, add the
'<fvwmopt cmd="Move" opt="w"/>'
(for "window") prefix before the
<replaceable>x</replaceable> and/or <replaceable>y</replaceable>
value.  To move the window to a position relative to the current
location of the pointer, add the
'<fvwmopt cmd="Move" opt="m"/>'
(for "mouse") prefix.  To leave either coordinate unchanged,
"<fvwmopt cmd="Move" opt="keep"/>" can be specified in place of
<replaceable>x</replaceable> or <replaceable>y</replaceable>.</para>

For advanced uses, the arguments
<replaceable>x</replaceable> and <replaceable>y</replaceable>
can be used multiple times, but without the prefix
'<replaceable>m</replaceable>' or '<replaceable>w</replaceable>'.
(See complex examples below).

<para>Simple Examples:</para>

<programlisting>
# Interactive move
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/> 1 T A Move
# Move window to top left is at (10%,10%)
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/> 2 T A Move 10 10
# Move top left to (10pixels,10pixels)
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/> 3 T A Move 10p 10p
</programlisting>

<para>More complex examples (these can be bound as actions to
keystrokes, etc.; only the command is shown, though):</para>

<programlisting>
# Move window so bottom right is at bottom
# right of screen
Move -0 -0

# Move window so top left corner is 10 pixels
# off the top left screen edge
Move +-10 +-10

# Move window 5% to the right, and to the
# middle vertically
Move w+5 50

# Move window up 10 pixels, and so left edge
# is at x=40 pixels
Move 40p w-10p

# Move window to the mouse pointer location
Move m+0 m+0

# Move window to center of screen (50% of screen
# poition minus 50% of widow size).
Move 50-50w 50-50w
</programlisting>
