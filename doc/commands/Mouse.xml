<para>Defines a mouse binding, or removes the binding if
<replaceable>Function</replaceable>
is '-'.
<replaceable>Button</replaceable>
is the mouse button number.  If
<replaceable>Button</replaceable>
is zero then any button performs the specified function.  Note
that only mouse buttons 1 to 5 are fully supported by X11.  Any
number above this works only partially.  Complex functions can not
be used with these buttons and neither any operation that requires
dragging the pointer with the button held.  This is due to
limitations of X11.  By default, the highest allowed button number
is 9.</para>

<para><replaceable>Context</replaceable>
describes where the binding applies.  Valid contexts are
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="R"/>' for the root window,
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="W"/>' for an application window,
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="D"/>' for a desktop application (as kdesktop or Nautilus desktop),
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="T"/>' for a window title-bar,
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="S"/>' for a window side, top, or bottom bar,
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="["/>',
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="]"/>',
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="-"/>' and
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="_"/>' for the left, right, top or bottom side only,
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="F"/>' for a window frame (the corners),
'&lt;', '^', '&gt;' and
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="v"/>' for the top
left, top right, bottom right or bottom left corner,
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="I"/>' for an icon window, or
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="0"/>' through
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="9"/>' for title-bar buttons, or any combination of these letters.
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="A"/>' is for any context.  For
instance, a context of "FST" applies when the mouse is anywhere in
a window's border except the title-bar buttons.  Only 'S' and 'W'
are valid for an undecorated window.</para>

<para>The special context '<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="M"/>' for menus can be used to (re)define the menu
controls. It can be used alone or together with 'T', 'S', 'I', '[', ']', '-' and '_'.  See the
<fvwmref sect="menus" opt="menu_bindings" name="Menu Bindings"/>
section for details.</para>

<para>The special context '<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="P"/>' controls what buttons that can be used to
place a window. When using this context no modifiers are allowed
(<replaceable>Modifiers</replaceable>
must be N), no
<replaceable>window</replaceable>
is allowed, and the
<replaceable>Function</replaceable>
must be one of
<emphasis remap='I'>PlaceWindow</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>PlaceWindowDrag</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>PlaceWindowInteractive</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>CancelPlacement</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>CancelPlacementDrag</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>CancelPlacementInteractive</emphasis> or
<emphasis remap='I'>-</emphasis>.</para>

<para>
<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="PlaceWindow"/>
makes
<replaceable>Button</replaceable>
usable for window placement, both for interactive and drag move.
<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="CancelPlacement"/>
does the inverse. That is makes
<replaceable>Button</replaceable>
to cancel move for both interactive and drag move. It may however
not override how new windows are resized after being placed. This
is controlled by the
<fvwmref cmd="Emulate"/>
command. Also a window being dragged can always be placed
by releasing the button hold while dragging, regardless of if it is
set to
<emphasis remap='I'>PlaceWindow</emphasis>
or not.</para>

<para>
<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="PlaceWindowDrag"/> and
<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="PlaceWindowInteractive"/>/<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="CancelPlacementDrag"/>
and <fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="CancelPlacementInteractive"/>
work as
<emphasis remap='I'>PlaceWindow</emphasis>/<emphasis remap='I'>CancelPlacement</emphasis>
with the exception that they only affect either windows dragged /
placed interactively.</para>

<para>
<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="-"/>
is equivalent to
<emphasis remap='I'>CancelPlacement</emphasis>.</para>

<para>The following example makes all buttons but button 3 usable for
interactive placement and makes drag moves started by other buttons
than one cancel if button 1 is pressed before finishing the move:</para>

<programlisting>
Mouse 0 P N PlaceWindow
Mouse 3 P N CancelPlacement
Mouse 1 P N CancelPlacementDrag
</programlisting>


<para>By default, the binding applies to all windows. You can specify
that a binding only applies to specific windows by specifying the
window name in brackets. The window name is a wildcard pattern
specifying the class, resource or name of the window you want the
binding to apply to.</para>

<para>The following example shows how the same key-binding can be used to
perform different functions depending on the window that is focused:</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Key"/> (rxvt)  V A C <fvwmref cmd="Echo"/> ctrl-V-in-RXVT
<fvwmref cmd="Key"/> (*term) V A C <fvwmref cmd="Echo"/> ctrl-V-in-Term
<fvwmref cmd="Key"/> (*vim)  V A C --
<fvwmref cmd="Key"/>         V A C <fvwmref cmd="Echo"/> ctrl-V-elsewhere
</programlisting>


<para>A '<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="--"/>' action indicates that the event should be propagated to the
specified window to handle. This is only a valid action for
window-specific bindings.</para>

<para>This example shows how to display the WindowList when Button 3 is
pressed on an rxvt window:</para>

<programlisting>
Mouse (rxvt) 3 A A <fvwmref cmd="WindowList"/>
</programlisting>


<para>Note that Fvwm actually intercepts all events for a window-specific
binding and (if the focused window doesn't match any of the
bindings) sends a synthetic copy of the event to the window. This
should be transparent to most applications, however (for security
reasons) some programs ignore these synthetic events by default -
xterm is one of them. To enable handling of these events, add the
following line to your <filename>~/.Xdefaults</filename> file:</para>


<programlisting>
XTerm*allowSendEvents:  true
</programlisting>


<para><replaceable>Modifiers</replaceable>
is any combination of
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="N"/>' for no modifiers,
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="C"/>' for control,
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="S"/>' for shift,
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="M"/>' for Meta,
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="L"/>' for Caps-Lock or
'<fvwmopt cmd="Mouse" opt="A"/>' for any
modifier. For example, a modifier of "SM" applies when both the
<keysym>Meta</keysym>
and
<keysym>Shift</keysym>
keys are down.  X11 modifiers mod1 through mod5 are represented as
the digits '1' through '5'.  The modifier 'L' is ignored by
default.  To turn it on, use the
<fvwmref cmd="IgnoreModifiers"/>
command.</para>

<para><replaceable>Function</replaceable>
is one of fvwm's commands.</para>

<para>The title-bar buttons are numbered with odd numbered buttons on
the left side of the title-bar and even numbers on the
right. Smaller-numbered buttons are displayed toward the outside
of the window while larger-numbered buttons appear toward the
middle of the window (0 is short for 10).  In summary, the buttons
are numbered:</para>

<programlisting>
1 3 5 7 9    0 8 6 4 2
</programlisting>

<para>The highest odd numbered button which has an action bound to it
determines the number of buttons drawn on the left side of the
title bar.  The highest even number determines the number of right
side buttons which are drawn.  Actions can be bound to either
mouse buttons or keyboard keys.</para>
