<para>Performs
<replaceable>command</replaceable>
(typically
<fvwmref cmd="Focus"/>)
on a window in the given direction which satisfies all
<replaceable>conditions</replaceable>.
Normally, the center of the currently focused window or the
context window in which the command was invoked is taken as the
starting point.  Lacking such a window, or when the
<fvwmopt cmd="Direction" opt="FromPointer"/>
option is given, the current position of the pointer is taken as
the starting point.  The
<replaceable>direction</replaceable>
may be one of "North", "Northeast", "East", "Southeast", "South",
"Southwest", "West", "Northwest" and "Center".  Which window
<emphasis remap='B'>Direction</emphasis>
selects depends on angle and distance between the center points of
the windows.  Closer windows are considered a better match than
those farther away.  The
<fvwmopt cmd="Direction" opt="Center"/>
direction simply selects the window closest to the starting point.
Returns -1 if an invalid direction was given.
See the <fvwmref sect="conditionals" opt="conditions" name="Conditions"/> section for a list of conditions.</para>
