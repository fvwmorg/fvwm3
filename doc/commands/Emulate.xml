</command>

<para>This command is a catch all for how miscellaneous things are done
by fvwm. Right now this command affects where the move/resize
feedback window appears and how window placement is aborted. To
have more Mwm- or Win-like behavior you can call
<emphasis remap='B'>Emulate</emphasis>
with
<fvwmopt cmd="Emulate" opt="Mwm"/> or
<fvwmopt cmd="Emulate" opt="Win"/>
as its argument.  With
Mwm
resize and move feedback windows are in the center of the screen,
instead of the upper left corner.
This also affects how manual placement is aborted.
See the <fvwmref cmd="Style" opt="ManualPlacement"/> description.</para>
