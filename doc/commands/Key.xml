<para>Binds a keyboard key to a specified fvwm command, or
removes the binding if
<fvwmref cmd="Function"/>
is '-'.  The syntax is the same as for a
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/>
binding except that the mouse button number is replaced with a
<emphasis remap='I'>Keyname</emphasis>.
Normally, the key binding is activated when the key is pressed.
<emphasis remap='I'>Keyname</emphasis>
is a standard X11 key name as defined in
<filename>/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h</filename>,
(without the
<emphasis remap='I'>XK_</emphasis>
prefix), or the keysym database
<filename>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB</filename>.
Only key names that are
generated with no modifier keys or with just the
<emphasis remap='SM'>Shift</emphasis>
key held are guaranteed to work.  The
<emphasis remap='I'>Context</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='I'>Modifiers</emphasis>
fields are defined as in the
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/>
binding.  However, when you press a key the context window is the
window that has the keyboard focus.  That is not necessarily the
same as the window the pointer is over (with
<fvwmref cmd="Style" opt="SloppyFocus"/> or
<fvwmref cmd="Style" opt="ClickToFocus"/>).
Note that key bindings with the '<fvwmopt cmd="Key" opt="R"/>' (root window) context do not
work properly with
<fvwmref cmd="Style" opt="SloppyFocus"/> and
<fvwmref cmd="Style" opt="ClickToFocus"/>.
If you encounter problems, use the
<fvwmref cmd="PointerKey"/>
command instead.  If you want to bind keys to a window with
<fvwmref cmd="Style" opt="SloppyFocus"/> or
<fvwmref cmd="Style" opt="ClickToFocus"/>
that are supposed to work when the pointer is not over the window,
fvwm assumes the pointer is over the client window (i.e. you have
to use the 'W' context).</para>

<para>The special context '<fvwmopt cmd="Key" opt="M"/>' for menus can be used to (re)define the menu
controls. It can only be used alone or together with 'T' for the menu
title bar.  See the
<fvwmref sect="menus" opt="menu_bindings" name="Menu Bindings"/>
section for details.</para>

<para>The following example binds the built-in window list to pop up
when
<emphasis remap='SM'>Alt-Ctrl-Shift-F11</emphasis>
is hit, no matter where the mouse pointer is:</para>

<programlisting>
Key F11 A SCM <fvwmref cmd="WindowList"/>
</programlisting>

<para>Binding a key to a title-bar button causes that button to appear.
Please refer to the
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/>
command for details.</para>
