<para>Sets the time between frames and the list of fractional offsets to
customize the animated moves of the
<fvwmref cmd="AnimatedMove"/>
command and the animation of menus (if the menu style is set to
animated; see
<fvwmref cmd="MenuStyle"/>
command).  If the
<emphasis remap='I'>fractions-to-move-list</emphasis>
is omitted, only the time between frames is altered.  The
<emphasis remap='I'>fractions-to-move-list</emphasis>
specifies how far the window should be offset at each successive
frame as a fraction of the difference between the starting
location and the ending location.  e.g.:</para>

<programlisting>
SetAnimation 10 -.01 0 .01 .03 .08 .18 .3 \
  .45 .6 .75 .85 .90 .94 .97 .99 1.0
</programlisting>

<para>Sets the delay between frames to 10 milliseconds, and sets the
positions of the 16 frames of the animation motion.  Negative
values are allowed, and in particular can be used to make the
motion appear more cartoonish, by briefly moving slightly in the
opposite direction of the main motion.  The above settings are the
default.</para>
