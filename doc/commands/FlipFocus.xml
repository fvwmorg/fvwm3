<para>Executes a
<fvwmref cmd="Focus"/>
command as if the user had used the pointer to select the
window. This command alters the order of the WindowList in the
same way as clicking in a window to focus, i.e. the target window
is removed from the
<emphasis remap='B'>WindowList</emphasis>
and placed at the start. This command is recommended for use with
the
<fvwmref cmd="Direction"/>
command and in the function invoked from
<fvwmref cmd="WindowList"/>.</para>
