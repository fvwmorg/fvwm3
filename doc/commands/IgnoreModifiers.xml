<para>Tells fvwm which modifiers to ignore when matching Mouse or Key
bindings.
<emphasis remap='B'>IgnoreModifiers</emphasis>
affects the
<fvwmref cmd="Style" opt="ClickToFocus"/>
style too.  This command belongs into your
<filename>config</filename>.
If you issue it when your fvwm session is already up and running
the results are unpredictable.  The should appear before any
applications or modules are started in your
<filename>config</filename>
file (e.g. with the
<fvwmref cmd="Exec"/>
command).</para>

<para><replaceable>Modifiers</replaceable>
has the same syntax as in the
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/> or <fvwmref cmd="Key"/>
bindings, with the addition of 'L' meaning the
<keysym>caps lock</keysym>
key.  The default is "L".
<replaceable>Modifiers</replaceable>
can be omitted, meaning no modifiers are ignored.  This command
comes in handy if the
<keysym>num-lock</keysym>
and
<keysym>scroll-lock</keysym>
keys interfere with your shortcuts.  With XFree86 '2' usually is
the
<keysym>num-lock</keysym>
modifier and '5' refers to the
<keysym>scroll-lock</keysym>
key. To turn all these pesky modifiers off you can use this
command:</para>

<programlisting>
IgnoreModifiers L25
</programlisting>

<para>If the
<replaceable>Modifiers</replaceable>
argument is the string "<fvwmopt cmd="IgnoreModifiers" opt="default"/>", fvwm reverts back to the
default value "L".</para>

<para><important>
This command creates a lot of extra network traffic, depending on
your CPU, network connection, the number of
<fvwmref cmd="Key"/> or <fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/>
commands in your configuration file and the number of modifiers
you want to ignore.  If you do not have a lightning fast machine
or very few bindings you should not ignore more than two
modifiers. I.e. do not ignore
<keysym>scroll-lock</keysym>
if you have no problem with it.  In the
<emphasis remap='I'>FAQ</emphasis>
you can find a better solution of this problem.</important></para>
