<para>Move a window in an animated fashion.  Similar to
<fvwmref cmd="Move"/>
command. The options are the same, except they are required,
since it doesn't make sense to have a user move the window
interactively and animatedly.  If the optional argument
<fvwmopt cmd="AnimatedMove" opt="Warp"/>
is specified the pointer is warped with the window.</para>
