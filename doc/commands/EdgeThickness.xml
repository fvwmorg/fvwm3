<para>This is the width or height of the invisible window that fvwm
creates on the edges of the screen that are used for the edge
scrolling feature.</para>

<para>In order to enable page scrolling via the mouse, four windows
called the "pan frames" are placed at the very edge of the
screen. This is how fvwm detects the mouse's presence at the
window edge. Because of the way this works, they need to be at the
top of the stack and eat mouse events, so if you have any kind of
error along the lines of: "mouse clicks at the edge of the screen
do the wrong thing" you're having trouble with the pan frames and
(assuming you do not use the mouse to flip between pages) should
set the EdgeThickness to 0.</para>

<para>A value of
<literal>0</literal>
completely disables mouse edge scrolling, even while dragging a
window.
<literal>1</literal>
gives the smallest pan frames, which seem to work best except on
some servers.</para>

<para><literal>2</literal>
is the default.</para>

<para>Pan frames of
<literal>1</literal> or <literal>2</literal>
pixels can sometimes be confusing, for example, if you drag a
window over the edge of the screen, so that it straddles a pan
frame, clicks on the window, near the edge of the screen are
treated as clicks on the root window.</para>
