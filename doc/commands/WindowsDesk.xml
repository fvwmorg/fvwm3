<para>Moves the selected window to another desktop.</para>

<para>This command has been removed and must be replaced by
<fvwmref cmd="MoveToDesk"/>,
the arguments for which are the same as for the
<fvwmref cmd="GotoDesk"/>
command.</para>

<important>
You cannot simply change the name of the command: the syntax has
changed.  If you used:

<programlisting>
WindowsDesk n
</programlisting>

<para>to move a window to desk n, you have to change it to:</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="MoveToDesk"/> 0 n
</programlisting>
