<cmdsynopsis>
	<arg choice='plain'>GotoDesk <emphasis>prev</emphasis> | <emphasis remap='I'>arg1</emphasis> [<emphasis remap='I'>arg2</emphasis>] [<emphasis remap='I'>min max</emphasis>]
	</arg>
</cmdsynopsis>
</command>

<para>
Switches the current viewport to another desktop (workspace, room).
</para>

<para>The command takes 1, 2, 3, or 4 arguments.  A single argument is
interpreted as a relative desk number.  Two arguments are
understood as a relative and an absolute desk number.  Three
arguments specify a relative desk and the minimum and maximum of
the allowable range. Four arguments specify the relative,
absolute, minimum and maximum values.  (Desktop numbers can be
negative).  If a literal
<emphasis remap='I'>prev</emphasis>
is given as the single argument, the last visited desk number is
used.</para>

<para>If
<emphasis remap='I'>arg1</emphasis>
is non zero then the next desktop number is the current desktop
number plus
<emphasis remap='I'>arg1</emphasis>.</para>

<para>If
<emphasis remap='I'>arg1</emphasis>
is zero then the new desktop number is
<emphasis remap='I'>arg2</emphasis>.
(If
<emphasis remap='I'>arg2</emphasis>
is not present, then the command has no effect.)</para>

<para>If
<emphasis remap='I'>min</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='I'>max</emphasis>
are given, the new desktop number is no smaller than
<emphasis remap='I'>min</emphasis>
and no bigger than
<emphasis remap='I'>max</emphasis>.
Values out of this range are truncated (if you gave an absolute
desk number) or wrapped around (if you gave a relative desk
number).</para>

<para>The syntax is the same as for
<fvwmref cmd="MoveToDesk"/>,
which moves a window to a different desktop.</para>

<para>The number of active desktops is determined dynamically.  Only
desktops which contain windows or are currently being displayed
are active.  Desktop numbers must be between 2147483647 and
-2147483648 (is that enough?).</para>
