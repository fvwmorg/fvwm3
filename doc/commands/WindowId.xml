<command>
<cmdsynopsis>
	<arg choice='plain'>WindowId [id] [(conditions)] | [root [screen]] command</arg>
</cmdsynopsis>
</command>


<para>The
<emphasis remap='B'>WindowId</emphasis>
command looks for a specific window
<emphasis remap='I'>id</emphasis>
and runs the specified
<emphasis remap='I'>command</emphasis>
on it.  The second form of syntax retrieves the window id of the
root window of the given
<emphasis remap='I'>screen</emphasis>.
If no
<emphasis remap='I'>screen</emphasis>
is given, the current screen is assumed.  The window indicated by
<emphasis remap='I'>id</emphasis>
may belong to a window not managed by fvwm or even a window on a
different screen.  Although most commands can not operate on such
windows, there are some exceptions, for example the
<emphasis remap='B'>WarpToWindow</emphasis>
command.
Returns -1 if no window with the given id exists.
See <fvwmref sect="conditionals" opt="conditions" name="Conditions"/> section for a list of conditions.</para>

<para>This command implies the conditions
<emphasis remap='I'>CirculateHit</emphasis>, <emphasis remap='I'>CirculateHitIcon</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='I'>CirculateHitShaded</emphasis>.
They can be turned off by specifying
<emphasis remap='I'>!CirculateHit</emphasis>
etc. explicitly.</para>

<para>Examples:</para>

<programlisting>
WindowId 0x34567890 <fvwmref cmd="Raise"/>
WindowId root 1 <fvwmref cmd="WarpToWindow"/> 50 50
WindowId $0 (Silly_Popup) <fvwmref cmd="Delete"/>
</programlisting>

<para>In the past this command was mostly useful for functions used with
the
<emphasis remap='B'>WindowList</emphasis>
command, or for selective processing of
<emphasis remap='B'>FvwmEvent</emphasis>
calls (as in the last example), but currently these handler functions
are called within a window context, so this command is not really
needed in these cases.  Still it may be useful if, for example, the
window id should be stored in the environment variable for a further
proceeding.</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Pick"/> <fvwmref cmd="SetEnv"/> BOOKMARKED_WINDOW $[w.id]
WindowId $[BOOKMARKED_WINDOW] <fvwmref cmd="WarpToWindow"/>
</programlisting>
