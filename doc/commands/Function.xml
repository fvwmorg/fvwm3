<para>Used to bind a previously defined function to a key or mouse
button. The following example binds mouse button 1 to a function
called "Move-or-Raise", whose definition was provided as an
example earlier in this man page.  After performing this binding
fvwm executes the "move-or-raise" function whenever button 1 is
pressed in a window's title-bar.</para>
