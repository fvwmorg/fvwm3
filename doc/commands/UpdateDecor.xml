</command>

<para>This command is deprecated and will be removed in the future.  There
are plans to replace it with a more flexible solution in fvwm-3.0.</para>

<para>This command is kept mainly for backward compatibility.  Since
all elements of a decor are updated immediately when they are
changed, this command is mostly useless.</para>

<para>Updates window decorations.
<emphasis remap='I'>decor</emphasis>
is an optional argument which specifies the
<emphasis remap='I'>decor</emphasis>
to update.  If given, only windows which are assigned to that
particular
<emphasis remap='I'>decor</emphasis>
are updated.  This command is useful, for instance, after a
<fvwmref cmd="ButtonStyle"/>, <emphasis remap='B'>TitleStyle</emphasis> or <emphasis remap='B'>BorderStyle</emphasis>
(possibly used in conjunction with
<fvwmref cmd="AddToDecor"/>).
Specifying an invalid decor results in all windows being
updated.  This command is less disturbing than
<fvwmref cmd="Recapture"/>,
but does not affect window style options as
<fvwmref cmd="Recapture"/>
does.</para>
