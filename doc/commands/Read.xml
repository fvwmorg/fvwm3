	<arg choice='plain'>Read filename [quiet]</arg>
</cmdsynopsis>
</command>

<para>Causes fvwm to read commands from the file named
<emphasis remap='I'>filename</emphasis>.
If the keyword
<emphasis remap='I'>Quiet</emphasis>
follows the command no message is produced if the file is not
found.  If the file name does not begin with a slash ('/'), fvwm
looks in the user's data directory, then the system data
directory.  The user's data directory is by default
<emphasis remap='I'>$HOME/.fvwm</emphasis>.
It can be overridden by exporting
<emphasis remap='I'>FVWM_USERDIR</emphasis>
set to any other directory.  The
<emphasis remap='B'>Read</emphasis>
command returns 1 if the given file could be read or -1 if not
(see the section
<fvwmref sect="conditionals" opt="conditional_commands" name="Conditional Commands"/>
for the meaning of return codes).</para>
