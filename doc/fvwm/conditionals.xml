<section id='conditional_commands'>
<title>Conditional Commands</title>


<para>Conditional commands are commands that are only executed if certain
conditions are met.  Most conditional commands work on windows,
like
<fvwmref cmd="Next"/>, <fvwmref cmd="ThisWindow"/> or <fvwmref cmd="All"/>.
There is one conditional command,
<fvwmref cmd="Test"/>,
that works on global conditions unrelated to windows.  The syntax
of the conditions is described below.  For readability, the list
of conditions is located at the end of this section.</para>


<section id="return_codes">
<title>Return Codes</title>

<para>All commands in this section (unless specifically stated for the
command) also have a return code that can be 1 (if the condition
was met) or 0 (if the condition was not met).  Some commands may
return -1 which means that an error occurred and the return code
is useless.  The
<emphasis remap='B'>Break</emphasis>
command returns -2.  Additionally, the return codes of commands
run in a complex functions are passed to the invoking complex
function.  The return code is used by the
<fvwmref cmd="TestRc"/>
command.  Please refer to the commands' description for examples.
The return code can also be accessed through the variable
<emphasis remap='I'>$[cond.rc]</emphasis>.
Non conditional commands do not modify the return code of the last
conditional command.  Important note:  return codes are only
defined inside functions created with the
<fvwmref cmd="AddToFunc"/>
command and are not inherited by sub functions.  To run a command
without altering the return code, the
<fvwmref cmd="KeepRc"/>
command can be used.</para>

</section>

<section id="ring_of_windows">
<title>The Ring of Windows</title>

<para>Fvwm stores windows in a ring internally.  Think of the focused
window as a cursor on the current position in the ring.  The
<fvwmref cmd="Next"/>
command and many other commands search forwards through the ring
for a matching window, and
<fvwmref cmd="Prev"/>
searches backwards.  The windows in the ring are either ordered by
creation time (if the
<emphasis remap='I'>!FPSortWindowlistByFocus</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>NeverFocus</emphasis> or <emphasis remap='I'>MouseFocus</emphasis>
styles are used) or by the last time they had the focus.</para>

<section id="conditions">
<title>Conditions</title>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>conditions</emphasis>
that may be given as an argument to any conditional command are a
list of keywords separated by commas, enclosed in
parentheses.  Unless stated otherwise, conditional commands accept
all the conditions listed below.  Note that earlier versions of
fvwm required the conditions to be separated by whitespace instead
of commas and enclosed in brackets instead of parentheses
(this is still supported for backward compatibility).</para>

<para>In addition, the
<emphasis remap='I'>conditions</emphasis>
may include one or more window names to match to.  If more than
one window name is given, all of them must match.  The window
name, icon name, class, and resource are considered when
attempting to find a match. Each name may include the wildcards
'*' and '?', and may consist of two or more alternatives,
separated by the character '|', which acts as an OR operator.  (If
OR operators are used, they must not be separated by spaces from
the names.)  Each window name can begin with '!', which prevents
<emphasis remap='I'>command</emphasis>
if any of the window name, icon name, class or resource match.
However, '!' must not be applied to individual names in a group
separated by OR operators; it may only be applied to the beginning
of the group, and then it operates on the whole group.</para>

<para>Examples:</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Next"/> ("Netscape|konqueror|Mozilla*") <fvwmref cmd="WarpToWindow"/> 99 90
</programlisting>

<para>This goes to the next web browser window, no matter which of the
three named web browsers is being used.</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Next"/> ("Mozilla*", "Bookmark*") <fvwmref cmd="WarpToWindow"/> 99 90
</programlisting>

<para>This goes to Mozilla's bookmark manager window, ignoring other
Mozilla windows and other browsers' bookmark windows.</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="All"/> ("XTerm|rxvt", !console) <fvwmref cmd="Iconify"/>
</programlisting>

<para>This iconifies all the xterm and rxvt windows on the current page,
except that the one named "console" (with the -name option to xterm)
is excluded.</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Next"/> (!"<fvwmref mod="FvwmPager"/>|<fvwmref mod="FvwmForm"/>*|<fvwmref mod="FvwmButtons"/>") <fvwmref cmd="Raise"/>
<fvwmref cmd="Next"/> (!<fvwmref mod="FvwmPager"/>, !<fvwmref mod="FvwmForm"/>*, !<fvwmref mod="FvwmButtons"/>) <fvwmref cmd="Raise"/>
</programlisting>

<para>These two commands are equivalent; either one raises the next window
which is not one of the named fvwm modules.</para>

<para>Any condition can be negated by using a an exclamation mark ('!')
directly in front of its name.</para>

<para><emphasis remap='I'>AcceptsFocus</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>AnyScreen</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>CirculateHit</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>CirculateHitIcon</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>CirculateHitShaded</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>Closable</emphasis>,

<emphasis remap='I'>Iconifiable</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>Layer [n]</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>Maximizable</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>Maximized</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>Overlapped</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>PlacedByButton n</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>PlacedByButton3</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>PlacedByFvwm</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>Raised</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>Shaded</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>State n</emphasis>,

<emphasis remap='I'>StickyAcrossDesks</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>StickyAcrossPages</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>StickyIcon</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>StickyAcrossDesksIcon</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>StickyAcrossPagesIcon</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>Transient</emphasis>,
<emphasis remap='I'>Visible</emphasis>.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>AcceptsFocus</emphasis>
condition excludes all windows that do not want the input focus
(the application has set the "Input hints" for the window to
False) and do not use the
<emphasis remap='I'>Lenience</emphasis>
option of the
<emphasis remap='B'>Style</emphasis>
command.  Also, all windows using the
<emphasis remap='I'>NeverFocus</emphasis>
style are ignored.
Note:
<emphasis>!Lenience</emphasis>
is equivalent to the deprecated option
<emphasis>NoLenience</emphasis>.</para>

<para>With the
<emphasis remap='I'>AnyScreen</emphasis>
condition used together with any of the
<emphasis remap='I'>Current...</emphasis>
conditions, windows that do not intersect the Xinerama screen
containing the mouse pointer are considered for a match too.  For
example:</para>

<programlisting>
# Focus next window on current page,
# regardless of Xinerama screen
<fvwmref cmd="Next"/> (CurrentPage, AnyScreen) <fvwmref cmd="Focus"/>
</programlisting>


<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>CirculateHit</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='I'>CirculateHitIcon</emphasis>
options override the
<emphasis remap='I'>CirculateSkip</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='I'>CirculateSkipIcon</emphasis>
<emphasis remap='B'>Style</emphasis>
attributes for normal or iconic windows.  The
<emphasis remap='I'>CirculateHitShaded</emphasis>
option overrides the
<emphasis remap='I'>CirculateSkipShaded</emphasis>
<emphasis remap='B'>Style.</emphasis>
All three options are turned on
by default for the
<fvwmref cmd="Current"/>
command.  They can be turned off by specifying
<emphasis remap='I'>!CirculateHit</emphasis>
etc. explicitly.
Note:  Do not confuse these conditions with the style options of
the same name.  Specifically,</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Style"/> foo CirculateSkip
<fvwmref cmd="Next"/> (foo, CirculateHit) ...
</programlisting>

<para>is not the same as</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Style"/> foo CirculateHit ...
<fvwmref cmd="Next"/> (foo)
</programlisting>

<para>The prior selects windows with the name foo only in the Next
command.  In the second example, these windows are always matched
in all conditional commands.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>Closable</emphasis>
condition matches only windows that are allowed to be closed.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>CurrentDesk</emphasis>
condition matches only windows that are on the current desk.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>CurrentGlobalPage</emphasis>
condition matches only windows that are on the current page of the
current desk, regardless of whether Xinerama support is enabled or
not.  This condition implicitly activates the
<emphasis remap='I'>CurrentDesk</emphasis>
condition.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>CurrentGlobalPageAnyDesk</emphasis>
condition matches only windows that are on the current page of any
desk, regardless of whether Xinerama support is enabled or not.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>CurrentPage</emphasis>
condition matches only windows that are on the current page of the
current desk.  If Xinerama support is enabled, it only matches
windows that are at least partially on the Xinerama screen
containing the mouse pointer.  This condition implicitly
activates the
<emphasis remap='I'>CurrentDesk</emphasis>
condition.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>CurrentPageAnyDesk</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='I'>CurrentScreen</emphasis>
conditions matches only windows that are on the current page of any
desk.  If Xinerama support is enabled, they only match windows
that are at least partially on the Xinerama screen containing the
mouse pointer.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>FixedPosition</emphasis>
condition excludes all windows that do not have a fixed position,
either set through WM hints or the
<emphasis remap='B'>Style</emphasis>
option
<emphasis remap='I'>FixedPosition</emphasis>.
Example:</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="DestroyFunc"/> ToggleFixedGeometry
<fvwmref cmd="AddToFunc"/>   ToggleFixedGeometry
+ I <fvwmref cmd="Pick"/> (FixedPosition) \
	<fvwmref cmd="WindowStyle"/> VariablePosition, VariableSize
+ I <fvwmref cmd="TestRc"/> (NoMatch) <fvwmref cmd="WindowStyle"/> FixedPosition, FixedSize
</programlisting>


<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>FixedSize</emphasis>
condition excludes all windows that do not have a fixed size,
either set through WM hints or the
<emphasis remap='B'>Style</emphasis>
option
<emphasis remap='I'>FixedSize</emphasis>.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>Focused</emphasis>
matches on the window that currently has the keyboard focus.
This is not useful for the
<emphasis remap='B'>Current</emphasis>
command but can be used with the other conditional commands.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>HasHandles</emphasis>
condition excludes all windows that do not have resize handles.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>HasPointer</emphasis>
condition excludes all windows that do not contain the pointer.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>Iconic</emphasis>
condition matches only iconic windows.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>Iconifiable</emphasis>
condition matches only windows that are allowed to be iconified.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>Layer [n]</emphasis>
condition matches only windows on the specified layer.  The
optional argument of the
<emphasis remap='I'>Layer</emphasis>
condition defaults to the layer of the focused window.  The
negation
<emphasis remap='I'>!Layer</emphasis>
switches off the
<emphasis remap='I'>Layer</emphasis>
condition.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>Maximizable</emphasis>
condition matches only windows that are allowed to be maximized.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>Maximized</emphasis>
condition matches only maximized windows.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>Overlapped</emphasis>
condition matches only windows that are overlapped by other windows
on the same layer (or unmanaged windows if the option
<emphasis remap='I'>RaiseOverUnmanaged</emphasis>
of the
<fvwmref cmd="BugOpts"/>
command is used).  Note that this condition can be slow if you
have many windows or if RaiseOverUnmanaged is used and the
connection to the X server is slow.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>PlacedByButton n</emphasis>
condition is fulfilled if the last interactive motion of the
window (with the
<fvwmref cmd="Move"/>
command or as
<emphasis remap='I'>ManualPlacement</emphasis>)
was ended by pressing mouse button
<emphasis remap='I'>n</emphasis>.
Example:</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/>   1 T     A       <fvwmref cmd="Function"/> MoveWindow

<fvwmref cmd="DestroyFunc"/> MoveWindow
<fvwmref cmd="AddToFunc"/> MoveWindow
+ C <fvwmref cmd="Move"/>
+ C <fvwmref cmd="ThisWindow"/> (PlacedByButton 5) <fvwmref cmd="WindowShade"/> off
+ C <fvwmref cmd="TestRc"/> (Match) <fvwmref cmd="Maximize"/> on 0 100
+ C <fvwmref cmd="ThisWindow"/> (PlacedByButton 4) <fvwmref cmd="WindowShade"/> on
</programlisting>


<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>PlacedByButton3</emphasis>
condition has the same meaning as
<emphasis remap='I'>PlacedByButton</emphasis>
3. It remains only for backward compatibility.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>PlacedByFvwm</emphasis>
condition excludes all windows that have been placed manually or
by using the user or program position hint.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>Raised</emphasis>
conditions matches only windows that are fully visible on the
current viewport and not overlapped by any other window.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>Shaded</emphasis>
conditions matches only shaded windows (see
<fvwmref cmd="WindowShade"/>
command).</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>State n</emphasis> or <emphasis remap='I'>!State n</emphasis>
conditions match only windows with the specified integer state set
(or unset).  See the
<fvwmref cmd="State"/>
command for details.  The argument may range from 0 to 31.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>Sticky</emphasis>, <emphasis remap='I'>StickyAcrossDesks</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='I'>StickyAcrossPages</emphasis>
match only windows that are currently sticky, sticky across all
desks or sticky across all pages.  Please refer to the
<fvwmref cmd="Style"/>
options with the same name and the commands
<fvwmref cmd="Stick"/>, <fvwmref cmd="StickAcrossDesks"/> and <fvwmref cmd="StickAcrossPages"/>
for details.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>StickyIcon</emphasis>, <emphasis remap='I'>StickyAcrossDesksIcon</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='I'>StickyAcrossPagesIcon</emphasis>
match only windows that become sticky, sticky across all desks or sticky
across all pages when they are in iconified state.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>Transient</emphasis>
condition matches only windows that have the "transient"
property set by the application.  This it usually the case for
application popup menus and dialogs.  The
<fvwmref mod="FvwmIdent"/>
module can be used to find out whether a specific window is
transient.</para>

<para>The
<emphasis remap='I'>Visible</emphasis>
condition matches only windows that are at least partially
visible on the current viewport and not completely overlapped by
other windows.</para>
