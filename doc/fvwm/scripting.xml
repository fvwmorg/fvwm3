<title>Scripting &amp; Complex Functions</title>

<para>To achieve the more complex effects, fvwm has a number of
commands that improve its scripting abilities.  Scripts can be
read from a file with
<fvwmref cmd="Read"/>,
from the output of a command with
<fvwmref cmd="PipeRead"/>
or written as a complex function with the
<fvwmref cmd="AddToFunc"/>
command.  For the curious, section 7 of the fvwm FAQ shows some
real life applications of scripting.  Please refer to the sections
<fvwmref sect="userFunctions" opt="user_functions_and_shell_commands" name="User Functions and Shell Commands"/>
and
<fvwmref sect="conditionals" opt="conditional_commands" name="Conditional Commands"/>
for details.  A word of warning:  during execution of complex
functions, fvwm needs to take all input from the mouse pointer
(the pointer is "grabbed" in the slang of X).  No other programs
can receive any input from the pointer while a function is run.
This can confuse some programs.  For example, the xwd program
refuses to make screen shots when run from a complex function.  To
achieve the same functionality you can use the
<fvwmref cmd="Read"/>
or
<fvwmref cmd="PipeRead"/>
command instead.</para>
