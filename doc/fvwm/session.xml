<title>Session Management</title>
<para>Fvwm supports session management according to the X Session
Management Protocol.  It saves and restores window position, size,
stacking order, desk, stickiness, shadiness, maximizedness,
iconifiedness for all windows. Furthermore, some global state is
saved.</para>

<para>Fvwm doesn't save any information regarding styles, decors,
functions or menus.  If you change any of these resources during a
session (e.g. by issuing
<fvwmref cmd="Style"/>
commands or by using various modules), these changes are lost
after saving and restarting the session.  To become permanent,
such changes have to be added to the configuration file.</para>

<para>Note further that the current implementation has the following
anomaly when used on a multi-screen display: Starting fvwm for the
first time, fvwm manages all screens by forking a copy of itself
for each screen.  Every copy knows its parent and issuing a
<fvwmref cmd="Quit"/>
command to any instance of fvwm kills the master and thus all
copies of fvwm.  When you save and restart the session, the
session manager brings up a copy of fvwm on each screen, but this
time they are started as individual instances managing one screen
only.  Thus a
<fvwmref cmd="Quit"/>
kills only the copy it was sent to.  This is probably not a very
serious problem, since with session management, you are supposed
to quit a session through the session manager anyway. If it is
really needed,</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Exec"/> exec killall fvwm
</programlisting>

<para>still kills all copies of fvwm.  Your system must have the
<command>killall</command>
command though.</para>
