<title>Bi-directional Text</title>
<para>Arabic and Hebrew text require bi-directional text support to be
displayed correctly, this means that logical strings should be
converted before their visual presentation, so left-to-right and
right-to-left sub-strings are determined and reshuffled.
In fvwm this is done automatically in window titles, menus,
module labels and other places if the fonts used for displaying the
text are of one of the charsets that require
<emphasis remap='I'>bidi</emphasis>
(bi-directional) support.  For example, this includes iso8859-6,
iso8859-8 and iso10646-1 (unicode), but not other iso8859-* fonts.</para>

<para>This bi-directional text support is done using the
<emphasis remap='I'>fribidi</emphasis>
library compile time option, see
<filename>INSTALL.fvwm</filename>.</para>
