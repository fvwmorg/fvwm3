<para>or</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Module"/> (rest of command)
</programlisting>

<para>This allows complex functions or modules to be invoked in a manner
which is fairly transparent to the configuration file.</para>

<para>Example: the
<emphasis remap='I'>config</emphasis>
file contains the line</para>

<programlisting>
HelpMe
</programlisting>

<para>Fvwm looks for an fvwm command called "HelpMe", and fails.
Next it looks for a user-defined complex function called "HelpMe".
If no such function exists, fvwm tries to execute a
module called "HelpMe".</para>

<title>Delayed Execution of Commands</title>
<para>Note: There are many commands that affect look and feel of
specific, some or all windows, like
<fvwmref cmd="Style"/>, <fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/>, <fvwmref cmd="Colorset"/>, <fvwmref cmd="TitleStyle"/>
and many others.  For performance reasons such changes are
not applied immediately but only when fvwm is idle, i.e. no user
interaction or module input is pending.  Specifically, new
<fvwmref cmd="Style"/>
options that are set in a function are not applied until after the
function has completed.  This can sometimes lead to unwanted
effects.</para>

<para>To force that all pending changes are applied immediately, use the
<fvwmref cmd="UpdateStyles"/>, <fvwmref cmd="Refresh"/> or <fvwmref cmd="RefreshWindow"/>
commands.</para>
