<title>Modules</title>
<para>A module is a separate program which runs as a separate Unix
process but transmits commands to fvwm to execute.  Users can
write their own modules to do any weird or bizarre manipulations
without bloating or affecting the integrity of fvwm itself.</para>

<para>Modules must be spawned by fvwm so that it can set up two pipes
for fvwm and the module to communicate with.  The pipes are
already open for the module when it starts and the file
descriptors for the pipes are provided as command line arguments.</para>

<para>Modules can be spawned by fvwm at any time during the X session by
use of the
<fvwmref cmd="Module"/>
command.  Modules can exist for the duration of the X
session, or can perform a single task and exit.  If the module is
still active when fvwm is told to quit, then fvwm closes the
communication pipes and waits to receive a SIGCHLD from the
module, indicating that it has detected the pipe closure and has
exited.  If modules fail to detect the pipe closure fvwm exits
after approximately 30 seconds anyway.  The number of
simultaneously executing modules is limited by the operating
system's maximum number of simultaneously open files, usually
between 60 and 256.</para>

<para>Modules simply transmit commands to the fvwm command
engine.  Commands are formatted just as in the case of a
mouse binding in the
<emphasis remap='I'>config</emphasis>
setup file.  Certain auxiliary information is also transmitted, as
in the sample module
<fvwmref mod="FvwmButtons"/>.
