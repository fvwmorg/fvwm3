<section id='command_expansion'>
<title>Command Expansion</title>

<para>Whenever an fvwm command line is executed, fvwm performs parameter
expansion.  A parameter is a '$' followed by a word enclosed in
brackets ($[...]) or a single special character.  If fvwm
encounters an unquoted parameter on the command line it expands it
to a string indicated by the parameter name.  Unknown parameters
are left untouched.  Parameter expansion is performed before
quoting.  To get a literal '$' use "$$".</para>

<para>If a command is prefixed with a '-' parameter expansion isn't
performed.  This applies to the command immediately following the '-',
in which the expansion normally would have taken place. When uesed
together with other prefix commands it must be added before the other
prefix.</para>

<para>Example:</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Pick"/> -<fvwmref cmd="Exec"/> exec xmessage '$[w.name]'
</programlisting>

<para>opens an xmessage dialog with "$[w.name]" unexpanded.</para>



<para>The longer variables may contain additional variables inside the
name, which are expanded before the outer variable.</para>

<para>In earlier versions of fvwm, some single letter variables were
supported.  It is deprecated now, since they cause a number of
problems.  You should use the longer substitutes instead.</para>

<para>Example:</para>

<programlisting>
# Print the current desk number, horizontal page number
# and the window's class (unexpanded here, no window).
<fvwmref cmd="Echo"/> $[desk.n] $[page.nx] $[w.class]
</programlisting>


<para>Note: If the command is called outside a window context, it
prints "$[w.class]" instead of the class name.  It is usually not
enough to have the pointer over a window to have a context window.
To force using the window with the focus, the
<fvwmref cmd="Current"/>
command can be used:</para>

<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Current"/> <fvwmref cmd="Echo"/> $[desk.n] $[page.nx] $[w.class]
</programlisting>

<para>The parameters known by fvwm are:</para>

svg rendering options (including the leading colon),
or unexpanded "$[w.&lt;attribute&gt;]" string if no window is associated
with the command.


Note, the first 4 variables may include any kind of characters, so
these variables are quoted.  It means that the value is surrounded
by single quote characters and any contained single quote is
prefixed with a backslash.  This guarantees that commands like:


<fvwmref cmd="Style"/> $[w.resource] <fvwmref cmd="Style" opt="Icon"/> norm/network.png


work correctly, regardless of any special symbols the value may
contain, like spaces and different kinds of quotes.

The context character of the running command as used in the
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/>,
<fvwmref cmd="Key"/> or
<fvwmref cmd="PointerKey"/>
command.  This is useful for example with:


<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/> 3 FS N <fvwmref cmd="WindowShade"/> $$[func.context]
<!--
<programlisting>
<fvwmref cmd="Mouse"/> 3 FS N <fvwmref cmd="WindowShade"/> $$[func.context]

<row>
	<entry>$[gt.str]</entry>
	<entry>
return the translation of
<emphasis remap='I'>str</emphasis>

command.
	</entry>
</row>
<row>
	<entry>$[...]</entry>
	<entry>
If the string within the braces is neither of the above, fvwm
tries to find an environment variable with this name and replaces
its value if one is found (e.g. "$[PAGER]" could be replaced by
"more").  Otherwise the string is left as is.
