	<entry>Used to determine the user's data directory for reading and
sometimes writing personal files. If this variable is not already
set, it is set by fvwm to $HOME/.fvwm, which is the default user's
data directory.</entry>

	<entry>This is used mainly to determine xsm running to work around its
bug. If this variable is set to "xsm", DiscardCommand is set as
xsm expects it and not as XSMP requires.  If you run fvwm under
xsm, you should set this variable to "xsm", otherwise old state
files are not removed.</entry>

	<entry>SM_SAVE_DIR</entry>
	<entry>If this is set, fvwm saves its session data in this
directory. Otherwise it uses
<emphasis remap='I'>$HOME</emphasis>.
Note, the state files are named
<markup>.fs-??????</markup>
and normally are removed automatically when not used anymore.</entry>
