<title>Keyboard Shortcuts</title>
<para>Almost all window manager operations can be performed from the
keyboard so mouse-less operation should be possible.  In addition
to scrolling around the virtual desktop by binding the
<fvwmref cmd="Scroll"/>
command to appropriate keys,
<fvwmref cmd="Popup"/>,
<fvwmref cmd="Move"/>,
<fvwmref cmd="Resize"/>, 
and any other command can be bound to keys.  Once a command
is started the pointer is moved by using the up, down,
left, and right arrows, and the action is terminated by pressing
return.  Holding down the
<keysym>Shift</keysym>
key causes the pointer movement to go in larger steps and holding
down the
<keysym>control</keysym>
key causes the pointer movement to go in smaller steps. Standard
emacs and vi cursor movement controls (
<keysym>n</keysym>,
<keysym>p</keysym>,
<keysym>f</keysym>,
<keysym>b</keysym>,
and
<keysym>j</keysym>,
<keysym>k</keysym>,
<keysym>h</keysym>,
<keysym>l</keysym>
) can be used instead of the arrow keys.</para>
