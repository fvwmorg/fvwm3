== NAME

FvwmIdent - the Fvwm identify-window module

== SYNOPSIS

FvwmIdent is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

== DESCRIPTION

The FvwmIdent module prompts the user to select a target window, if the
module was not launched from within a window context in Fvwm. After
that, it pops up a window with information about the window which was
selected.

== COPYRIGHTS

The FvwmIdent program, and the concept for interfacing this module to
the Window Manager, are all original work by Robert Nation and Nobutaka
Suzuki.

Copyright 1994, Robert Nation and Nobutaka Suzuki. No guarantees or
warranties or anything are provided or implied in any way whatsoever.
Use this program at your own risk. Permission to use this program for
any purpose is given, as long as the copyright is kept intact.

== INITIALIZATION

During initialization, _FvwmIdent_ gets config info from *fvwm*'s module
configuration database (see _fvwm_(1), section *MODULE COMMANDS*) to
determine which colors and font to use.

If the FvwmIdent executable is linked to another name, ie ln -s
FvwmIdent MoreIdentify, then another module called MoreIdentify can be
started, with a completely different configuration than FvwmIdent,
simply by changing the keyword FvwmIdent to MoreIdentify. This way
multiple clutter-reduction programs can be used.

== INVOCATION

FvwmIdent can be invoked by binding the action 'Module FvwmIdent' to a
menu or key-stroke in the .fvwm2rc file. Fvwm will search directory
specified in the ModulePath configuration option to attempt to locate
FvwmIdent. Although nothing keeps you from launching FvwmIdent at
start-up time, you probably don't want to. Clicking into the FvwmIdent
window or pressing a key while it has focus closes FvwmIdent. Pressing
mouse button 2 in the window restarts FvwmIdent and asks for a new
window to select.

== CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

FvwmIdent reads the same .fvwm2rc file as fvwm reads when it starts up,
and looks for lines as listed below:

*FvwmIdent: Colorset n::
  Tells the module to use colorset _n_.
*FvwmIdent: Fore color::
  Tells the module to use _color_ instead of black for text. Switches
  off the Colorset option.
*FvwmIdent: Back color::
  Tells the module to use _color_ instead of white for the window
  background. Switches off the Colorset option.
*FvwmIdent: Font fontname::
  Tells the module to use _fontname_ instead of fixed for text.
*FvwmIdent: MinimalLayer layer::
  FvwmIdent places its window on the layer of a target window. But not
  below the minimal layer. By default, the minimal layer is 4 just like
  the fvwm default layer. If _layer_ is 0, the layer of the target
  window is always used. If _layer_ is "default" or not specified, the
  default behavior is restored. If _layer_ is "none", FvwmIdent is
  placed as a normal window even if the target window is above it.
