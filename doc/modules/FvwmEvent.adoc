== NAME

FvwmEvent - the fvwm event module

== SYNOPSIS

_FvwmEvent_ is a more versatile replacement for _FvwmAudio_. It can in
general be used to hook any _fvwm_ function or program to any window
manager event. E.g: Delete unwanted Netscape Pop ups or application
error pop ups as they appear, play sounds, log events to a file and the
like. Be creative, you'll find a use for it.

_FvwmEvent_ is spawned by _fvwm_, so no command line invocation will
work. From within the _.fvwm2rc_ file, _FvwmEvent_ is spawned as
follows:

....
Module FvwmEvent
....

or from within an _fvwm_ pop-up menu:

....
DestroyMenu Module-Popup
AddToMenu Module-Popup "Modules" Title
+ "Event"        Module FvwmEvent
+ "Auto"         Module FvwmAuto 200
+ "Buttons"      Module FvwmButtons
+ "Console"      Module FvwmConsole
+ "Ident"        Module FvwmIdent
+ "Banner"       Module FvwmBanner
+ "Pager"        Module FvwmPager 0 3
....

== DESCRIPTION

The _FvwmEvent_ module communicates with the _fvwm_ window manager to
bind _actions_ to window manager _events_. Different actions may be
assigned to distinct window manager events.

_FvwmEvent_ can be used to bind sound files to events like _FvwmAudio_
(RiP) did. It can be used for logging event traces to a log file, while
debugging _fvwm_.

== INVOCATION

The invocation method was shown in the synopsis section. No command line
invocation is possible. _FvwmEvent_ must be invoked by the _fvwm_ window
manager.

== CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

_FvwmEvent_ gets config info from *fvwm*'s module configuration database
(see _fvwm_(1), section *MODULE COMMANDS*), and looks for certain
configuration options:

*FvwmEvent: Cmd command::
  This determines the _fvwm_ function that is to be called with the
  event parameters. You might want to do one of the following (details
  below):
+
....
	# execute distinct fvwm functions
	*FvwmEvent: Cmd

	# execute distinct external programs
	*FvwmEvent: Cmd exec
....
+
_FvwmEvent_ has support for any other external program. e.g: the
rsynth 'say' command:
+
....
	*FvwmEvent: Cmd "Exec /rsynth/say"
	*FvwmEvent: destroy_window "window closed"
....
+
You can also use _fvwm_'s builtin _Echo_ command as _FvwmEvent: Cmd_ to
obtain debug output for _fvwm_ events quietly. I used this setup to
debug FvwmAuto:
+
....
	*FvwmEvent: Cmd Echo
	*FvwmEvent: focus_change "focus change"
	*FvwmEvent: raise_window "raise window"
....
+
You can even call different shell commands for each event just by
setting
+
....
	*FvwmEvent: Cmd exec
	*FvwmEvent: add_window 'killname "APPL ERROR"'
....

*FvwmEvent: PassId::
  Specifies that the event action will have an ID parameter added to the
  end of the command line. Most events will have the windowID of the
  window that the event refers to, new_desk will have the new desk
  number. The windowID is a hexadecimal string preceded by 0x, desk
  numbers are decimal.

*FvwmEvent: window-manager-event action-or-filename::
  Binds particular actions to window manager events.
+
The following events are valid:

+
The window related event handlers are executed within a window context.
Previously PassId was used for this purpose, but now using PassId is not
needed.
+
The monitor_* events do not operate in a window context (as there isn't
one), but react to when a monitor is plugged in (enabled), unplugged
(disabled), focused (focus) or changed (resized/rotated, etc., which
will only be true if the monitor is already active). In all cases, the
monitor name is is passed through to the command, hence the following
example prints out the changed monitor's name, and width/height values:
+
....
	DestroyFunc MonitorExample
	AddToFunc   MonitorExample
	+ I Echo "Monitor $0 changed ($[monitor.$0.width] x $[monitor.$0.height])

	*FvwmEvent: monitor_changed MonitorExample
....
+
The echo event is generated whenever Fvwm receives an Echo command.
+
Note: The enter_window event is generated when the pointer enters a
window. With the -passid option, that window's id is passed to fvwm. An
enter_window event is generated too when the pointer leaves a window and
moves into the root window. In this case, the id passed is 0.
+
Note: When the shutdown event arrives, FvwmEvent may be killed before it
can trigger the associated action.

*FvwmEvent: Delay 5::
  Specifies that an event-action will only be executed if it occurs at
  least 5 seconds after the previous event. Events that occur during the
  delay period are ignored. The default delay is 0 which disables the Event.

*FvwmEvent: StartDelay delay::
  Specifies that an event-action will only be executed if it occurs at
  least _delay_ seconds after the startup event. Events that occur
  during the delay period are ignored. This option is useful when _fvwm_
  starts and restarts using an audio player. The default delay is 0.

== HISTORY

This module has evolved of _FvwmAudio_, which in term is heavily based
on a similar Fvwm module called _FvwmSound_ by Mark Boyns. _FvwmAudio_
simply took Mark's original program and extended it to make it generic
enough to work with any audio player. Due to different requests to do
specific things on specific events, _FvwmEvent_ took this one step
further and now calls any _fvwm_ function, or builtin-rplay. If _fvwm_'s
Exec function is used, any external program can be called with any
parameter.
