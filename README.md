Welcome to fvwm3.  Fvwm3 is a multiple large virtual desktop window manager,
originally (a looooong time ago!) derived from twm.

The successor to [fvwm2](http://github.com/fvwmorg/fvwm).

Fvwm3 is intended to have a small memory footprint but a rich feature set, be
extremely customizable and extendible, and have a high degree of Motif mwm
compatibility.

**Currently, your existing fvwm2 config will work with fvwm3**

Releases
--------

* None.  fvwm3 is in development still.  The `master` branch contains what could
  be considered stable for now, but even then there are no guarantees of
  stability.

Installation
------------

See [the installation instructions](./dev-docs/INSTALL.md)

Help & Support
--------------

We have a strong community on IRC (freenode), in the `#fvwm` channel if you
fancy a chat.

There is also the [Fvwm Forums](https://fvwmforums.org) where you can ask
questions.

Issues (for bugs) can be opened, and any/all bug reports are appreciated!

Development
-----------

Those interested in contributing to FVWM3 should have [a read of the developer
documentation](./dev-docs/DEVELOPERS.md).

* A [TODO file](./dev-docs/TODO.md) exists, and sometimes even things from it are
worked on.

* New commands and config file syntax thoughts [are being documented here](./dev-docs/NEW-COMMANDS.md).

Please open a github issue or contact me directly if you wish to discuss a
particular feature of issue you need help with.
