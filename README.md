Welcome to fvwm.  Fvwm is a multiple large virtual desktop window manager,
originally (a looooong time ago!) derived from twm.

Fvwm is intended to have a small memory footprint but a rich feature set, be
extremely customizable and extendible, and have a high degree of Motif mwm
compatibility.

Releases
--------

* None.  fvwm3 is in development still.  The master branch contains what could
  be considered "stable" for now, but even then there are no guarantees of
  stability.

Installation
------------

See [the installation instructions](./dev-docs/INSTALL.md)

Development
-----------

Those interested in contributing to FVWM should have [a read of the developer
documentation](./dev-docs/DEVELOPERS.md).

* A [TODO file](./dev-docs/TODO.md) exists, and sometimes even things from it are
worked on.

* New commands and config file syntax thoughts [are being documented here](./dev-docs/NEW-COMMANDS.md).

Comments, Questions?
