Welcome to fvwm.  Version 3 is a multiple large virtual desktop window manager.

The successor to [fvwm-2.6.x](http://github.com/fvwmorg/fvwm).

Fvwm3 is intended to be extremely customizable and extendible while consuming
a relatively small amount of resources.

**An existing version 2 configuration currently works, but over time this will
change.**
