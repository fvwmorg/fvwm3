FVWM
----

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fvwmorg/fvwm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fvwmorg/fvwm)

Welcome to fvwm.  Fvwm is a multiple large virtual desktop window manager,
originally (a looooong time ago!) derived from twm.

Fvwm is intended to have a small memory footprint but a rich feature set, be
extremely customizable and extendible, and have a high degree of Motif mwm
compatibility.

Releases
--------

* None.  fvwm3 is in development still.  The master branch contains what could
  be considered "stable" for now, but even then there are no guarantees of
  stability.

Installation
------------

See [the installation instructions](./dev-docs/INSTALL.md)

Development
-----------

Those interested in contributing to FVWM should have [a read of the developer
documentation](./dev-docs/DEVELOPERS.md).

* A [TODO file](./dev-docs/TODO.md) exists, and sometimes even things from it are
worked on.

* New commands and config file syntax thoughts [are being documented here](./dev-docs/NEW-COMMANDS.md).

Comments, Questions?
--------------------

There is the `#fvwm` IRC channel on `freenode.net` which you can use to chat
to people about FVWM.

If you have any questions, concerns, bug reports, enhancement requests,
etc., please feel free to send an email to the fvwm mailing list, or open a
Github issue.

Have fun!
