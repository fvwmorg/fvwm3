Welcome to fvwm.  Version 3 is a multiple large virtual desktop window manager.

The successor to [fvwm-2.6.x](http://github.com/fvwmorg/fvwm).

Fvwm3 is intended to be extremely customizable and extendible while consuming
a relatively small amount of resources.

Fvwm2 Compatibility
-------------------

Although an existing fvwm2 configuration should mostly work with fvwm3, it
isn't guaranteed to work without some modifications.  This is because fvwm3
has changed, often removing long-standing deprecated options.

More details about those changes [can be found here](https://github.com/fvwmorg/fvwm3/discussions/878)

Releases / Changelog
