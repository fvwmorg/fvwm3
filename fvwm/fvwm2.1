.SH NAME
fvwm2 \- F(?) Virtual Window Manager (version 2.xx) for X11
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfvwm\fP [ \fIoptions\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIFvwm\fP is a window manager for X11.  It is a derivative of
\fItwm\fP, redesigned to minimize memory consumption, provide a 3-D
look to window frames, and provide a simple virtual desktop.  Version
2.xx uses only slightly more memory than 1.xx, mostly due to some
global options being able to be window specific now.

Fvwm provides both a large virtual desktop and multiple disjoint
desktops which can be used separately or together.  The virtual desktop
allows you to pretend that your video screen is really quite large,
and you can scroll around within the desktop.  The multiple disjoint
desktops allow you to pretend that you really have several screens to
work at, but each screen is completely unrelated to the others.

Fvwm provides keyboard accelerators which allow you to perform most
window-manager functions, including moving and resizing windows, and
operating the window-manager's menus, using keyboard shortcuts.

Fvwm has also blurred the distinction between configuration commands
and built-in commands that most window-managers make.  Configuration
commands typically set fonts, colors, menu contents, key and mouse
function bindings, while built-in commands typically do things like
raise and lower windows.  Fvwm makes no such distinction, and allows,
to the extent that is practical, anything to be changed at any time.

Other noteworthy differences between Fvwm and other X11 window managers
are the introduction of the SloppyFocus and per-window focus methods.
SloppyFocus is focus-follows-mouse, but focus is not removed from
windows when the mouse leaves a window and enters the root window.
When sloppy focus is used as the default focus style, it is nice to
make windows in which you do not typically type into (xmag, xman,
xgraph, xclock, xbiff, etc) click-to-focus, so that your terminal
window doesn't lose focus unnecessarily.

.SH COPYRIGHTS
Since \fIfvwm\fP is derived from \fItwm\fP code it shares \fItwm\fP's
copyrights.  Since nearly every line of twm code has been changed, the
twm copyright has been removed from most of the individual code files.
I do still recognize the influence of twm code in the overall package,
so fvwm's copyright is still considered to be the same as twm's.

Please consult the COPYING file that has come with your distribution
for details.

.SH ANATOMY OF A WINDOW
\fIFvwm\fP puts a decorative border around most windows.  This border
consists of a bar on each side and a small "L" shaped section on each
corner.  There is an additional top bar called the title bar which is
used to display the name of the window.  In addition, there are up to
10 title-bar buttons.  The top, side, and bottom bars are collectively
known as the side-bars.  The corner pieces are called the frame.

Unless the standard defaults files are modified, pressing mouse button
1 in the title or side-bars will begin a move operation on the
window.  Pressing button 1 in the corner frame pieces will begin a
resize operation.  Pressing button 2 anywhere in the border brings up
an extensive list of window operations.

Up to ten title-bar buttons may exist.  Their use is completely user
definable.  The default configuration has a title-bar button on each
side of the title-bar.  The one on the left is used to bring up a list
of window options, regardless of which mouse button is used.  The one
on the right is used to iconify the window.  The number of title-bar
buttons used depends on which ones have mouse actions bound to
them.  See the section on the "Mouse" configuration parameter below.


.SH THE VIRTUAL DESKTOP
\fIFvwm\fP provides multiple virtual desktops for users who wish to
use them.  The screen is a viewport onto a desktop which may be larger
than the screen.  Several distinct desktops can be accessed (concept:
one desktop for each project, or one desktop for each application,
when view applications are distinct).  Since each desktop can be
larger than the physical screen, divided into m by n pages which are
each the size of the physical screen, windows which are larger than
the screen or large groups of related windows can easily be viewed.

The (m by n) size (i.e. number of pages) of the virtual desktops can be
changed any time, by using the DeskTopSize built-in command.  All
virtual desktops must be (are) the same size.  The total number of
distinct desktops need not be specified, but is limited to
approximately 4 billion total.  All windows on a range of desktops can
be viewed in the Pager, a miniature view of the desktops.  The pager
is an accessory program, called a module, which is not essential for
the window manager to operate.  Windows may also be listed, along with
their geometries, in a window list, accessible as a pop-up menu, or as
a separate window, called the FvwmWinList (another module).

"Sticky" windows are windows which transcend the virtual desktop by
"Sticking to the screen's glass."  They always stay put on the screen.
This is convenient for things like clocks and xbiff's, so you only need
to run one such gadget and it always stays with you.  Icons can also be
made to stick to the glass, if desired.

Window geometries are specified relative to the current viewport.  That
is:
.EX
xterm -geometry +0+0
.EE
will always show up in the upper-left hand
corner of the visible portion of the screen.  It is permissible to
specify geometries which place windows on the virtual desktop, but off
the screen.  For example, if the visible screen is 1000 by 1000 pixels,
and the desktop size is 3x3, and the current viewport is at the upper
left hand corner of the desktop, then invoking:
.EX
xterm -geometry +1000+1000
.EE
will place the window just off of the lower right hand corner of the
screen.  It can be found by moving the mouse to the lower right hand
corner of the screen and waiting for it to scroll into view.

A geometry specified as something like:
.EX
xterm -geometry -5-5
.EE
will
generally place the window's lower right hand corner 5 pixels from the
lower right corner of the visible portion of the screen. Not all
applications support window geometries with negative offsets. Some will
place the window's upper right hand corner 5 pixels above and to the left
of the upper left hand corner of the screen; others may do just plain
bizarre things.


There are several ways to cause a window to map onto a desktop or page
other than the currently active one. The geometry technique mentioned above
(specifying x,y coordinates larger than the physical screen size), however,
suffers from the limitation of being interpreted relative to the current
viewport: the window will not consistently appear on a specific page, unless
you always invoke the application from the same page.

A better way to place windows on a different page or desk from the
currently mapped viewport is to use the StartsOnPage style specification
(the successor to the older StartsOnDesk style) in the .fvwm2 configuration
file. The placement is consistent: it does not depend on your current location
on the virtual desktop.

Some applications that understand standard Xt command line arguments
and X resources, like xterm and xfontsel, allow the user to specify
the start-up desk or page on the command line:
.EX
xterm -xrm "*Desk:1"
.EE
will start an xterm on desk number 1;
.EX
xterm -xrm "*Page:3 2 1"
.EE
will start an xterm two pages to the right and one down from the upper
left hand page of desk number 3. Not all applications understand the use
of these options, however.

You could achieve the same results with the following lines in your
.Xdefaults file:
.EX
XTerm*Desk: 1
.EE
or
.EX
XTerm*Page: 3 2 1
.EE

.SH INITIALIZATION
During initialization, \fIfvwm\fP will search for a configuration file
which describes key and button bindings, and a few other things.  The
format of these files will be described later.  First, \fIfvwm\fP will
search for a file named .fvwm2rc in the user's home directory, then in
${sysconfdir} (typically /usr/local/etc).
Failing that, it will look for system.fvwm2rc in ${sysconfdir} for
system-wide defaults.  If that file is not found, \fIfvwm\fP will be
basically useless.

\fIFvwm\fP will set two environment variables which will be inherited
by its children.  These are $DISPLAY which describes the display on
which \fIfvwm\fP is running.  $DISPLAY may be unix:0.0 or :0.0, which
doesn't work too well when passed through rsh to another machine, so
$HOSTDISPLAY will also be set and will use a network-ready description
of the display.  $HOSTDISPLAY will always use the TCP/IP transport
protocol (even for a local connection) so $DISPLAY should be used for
local connections, as it may use Unix-domain sockets, which are
faster.

\fIFvwm\fP has a two special functions for initialization:
InitFunction and RestartFunction, which are executed during
Initialization and Restarts (respectively).  These may be customized
in the user's rc file via the AddToFunc facility (described later) to
start up modules, xterms, or whatever you'd like have started by
\fIfvwm\fP.

\fIFvwm\fP also has a special exit function: ExitFunction, executed
when exiting or restarting before actually quitting or anything else.
It could be used to explicitly kill modules, etc.

.SH COMPILATION OPTIONS
\fIFvwm\fP has a number of compile-time options to reduce memory usage
by limiting the use of certain features.  If you
have trouble using a certain command or feature, check to see if
support for it was included at compile time.  Optional features are
described in the config.h file.

.SH ICONS
The basic \fIFvwm\fP configuration uses monochrome bitmap icons,
similar to \fItwm\fP.  If XPM extensions are compiled in, then color
icons similar to ctwm, MS-Windows, or the Macintosh icons can be used.
In order to use these options you will need the XPM package, as
described in the INSTALL.fvwm file.

If both the SHAPE and XPM options are compiled in you will get shaped
color icons, which are very spiffy.

.SH MODULES
A module is a separate program which runs as a separate Unix process
but transmits commands to \fIfvwm\fP to execute.  Users can write
their own modules to do any weird or bizarre manipulations without
bloating or affecting the integrity of \fIfvwm\fP itself.

Modules MUST be spawned by \fIfvwm\fP so that it can set up two pipes for
\fIfvwm\fP and the module to communicate with.  The pipes will already be
open for the module when it starts and the file descriptors for the
pipes are provided as command line arguments.

Modules can be spawned during \fIfvwm\fP at any time during the X
session by use of the Module built-in command.  Modules can exist for
the duration of the X session, or can perform a single task and exit.
If the module is still active when \fIfvwm\fP is told to quit, then
\fIfvwm\fP will close the communication pipes and wait to receive a
SIGCHLD from the module, indicating that it has detected the pipe
closure and has exited.  If modules fail to detect the pipe closure
\fIfvwm\fP will exit after approximately 30 seconds anyway.  The
number of simultaneously executing modules is limited by the operating
system's maximum number of simultaneously open files, usually between
60 and 256.

Modules simply transmit text commands to the \fIfvwm\fP built-in
command engine.  Text commands are formatted just as in the case of a
mouse binding in the .fvwm2rc setup file.  Certain auxiliary
information is also transmitted, as in the sample module FvwmButtons.
The FvwmButtons module is documented in its own man page.

.SH ICCCM COMPLIANCE
\fIFvwm\fP attempts to be ICCCM 1.1 compliant.  In addition, ICCCM
states that it should be possible for applications to receive ANY
keystroke, which is not consistent with the keyboard shortcut approach
used in \fIfvwm\fP and most other window managers. In particular you
cannot have the same keyboard shortcuts working with your fvwm2 and
another fvwm2 running within Xnest (a nested X server). The same problem
exists with mouse bindings.

The ICCCM states that windows possessing the property
.EX
WM_HINTS(WM_HINTS):
    Client accepts input or input focus: False
.EE
should not be given the keyboard input focus by the window manager.
These windows can take the input focus by themselves, however.  A
number of applications set this property, and yet expect the
window-manager to give them the keyboard focus anyway, so fvwm
provides a window-style, "Lenience", which will allow fvwm to overlook
this ICCCM rule.


.SH M4 PREPROCESSING
.PP
M4 pre-processing is handled by a module in fvwm-2.0.  To get more
details, try man FvwmM4.  In short, if you want fvwm to parse your
files with m4, then replace the word "Read" with "FvwmM4" in
your .fvwm2rc file (if it appears at all), and start fvwm with the
command
.EX
fvwm -cmd "FvwmM4 .fvwm2rc"
.EE

.SH CPP PREPROCESSING
.PP
Cpp is the C-language pre-processor.  fvwm-2.0 offers cpp processing
which mirrors the m4 pre-processing.  To find out about it, re-read
the M4 section above, but replace "m4" with "cpp".

.SH AUTO-RAISE
.PP
Windows can be automatically raised when it receives focus, or some
number of milliseconds after it receives focus, by using the
auto-raise module, FvwmAuto.

.SH OPTIONS
These are the command line options that are recognized by \fIfvwm\fP:
.IP "\fB-blackout\fP"
The screen is blacked out during window recaptures and startup. This option
is provided for backwards compatibility only.
.IP "\fB-cmd\fP \fIconfig_command\fP"
Causes \fIfvwm\fP to use \fIconfig_command\fP instead of "Read .fvwm2rc"
as its initialization command.
(Note that up to 10 \fB-f\fP and \fB-cmd\fP parameters can be given,
and they are executed in the order specified.)
.IP "\fB-d\fP \fIdisplayname\fP"
Manage the display called "displayname" instead of the name obtained from
the environment variable $DISPLAY.
.IP "\fB-debug\fP"
Puts X transactions in synchronous mode, which dramatically slows things
down, but guarantees that \fIfvwm\fP's internal error messages are correct.
Also causes \fIfvwm\fP to output debug messages while running.
.IP "\fB-f\fP \fIconfig_file\fP"
Causes \fIfvwm\fP to Read \fIconfig_file\fP instead of ".fvwm2rc"
as its initialization file.  This is equivalent to
\fB-cmd\fP "Read \fIconfig_file\fP".
.IP "\fB-h\fP"
A short usage description is printed.
.IP "\fB-s\fP"
On a multi-screen display, run \fIfvwm\fP only on the screen named in
the $DISPLAY environment variable or provided through the -d
option. Normally, \fIfvwm\fP will attempt to start up on all screens
of a multi-screen display.
.IP "\fB-version\fP"
Print the version of \fIfvwm\fP to stderr.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
The configuration file is used to describe mouse and button bindings,
colors, the virtual display size, and related items.  The
initialization configuration file is typically called ".fvwm2rc".  By
using the "Read" built-in, it is easy to read in new configuration
files as you go.

Lines beginning with '#' will be ignored by \fIfvwm\fP.  Lines
starting with '*' are expected to contain module configuration
commands (rather than configuration commands for \fIfvwm\fP itself).

Fvwm makes no distinction between configuration commands and built-in
commands, so anything mentioned in the built-in commands section  can
be placed on a line by itself for fvwm to execute as it reads the
configuration file, or it can be placed as an executable command in a
menu or bound to a mouse button or a keyboard key.  It is left as an
exercise for the user to decide which function make sense for
initialization and which ones make sense for run-time.

.SH BUILT IN FUNCTIONS
\fIFvwm\fP supports a set of built-in functions which can be bound to
keyboard or mouse buttons.  If fvwm expects to find a built-in function
in a command, but fails, it will check to see if the specified command
should have been "Function (rest of command)" or "Module (rest of
command)".  This allows complex functions or modules to be invoked in a
manner which is fairly transparent to the configuration file.

Example: the .fvwm2rc file contains the line "HelpMe".  Fvwm will look
for a built-in command called "HelpMe", and will fail. Next it will
look for a user-defined complex function called "HelpMe".  If no such
user defined function exists, Fvwm will try to execute a module called
"HelpMe".

In previous versions of fvwm, quoting was critical and irrational in
the .fvwmrc file.  As of fvwm-2, most of this has been cleared up.
Quotes are required only when needed to make fvwm consider two or more
words to be a single argument.  Unnecessary quoting is allowed.  If you
want a quote character in your text, you must escape it by using the
backslash character.  For example, if you have a pop-up menu called
Window-Ops, then you don't need quotes: Popup Window-Ops, but if you
replace the dash with a space, then you need quotes: Popup "Window
Ops".


.IP "AddButtonStyle \fIbutton\fP [ \fIstate\fP ] [ \fIstyle\fP ] [-- \fI[!]flag ...\fP]"
Adds a button style to \fIbutton\fP.  \fIbutton\fP can be a button
number, or one of "All," "Left," or "Right."  \fIstate\fP can be
"ActiveUp," "ActiveDown" or "Inactive."  If \fIstate\fP is omitted,
then the style is added to every state.  If the button style and flags
are enclosed in parentheses, then multiple state definitions can be
placed on a single line.  Flags for additional button styles cannot be
changed after definition.

Buttons are drawn in the order of definition, beginning with the most
recent ButtonStyle, followed by those added with AddButtonStyle.  To
clear the button style stack, change style flags, or for descriptions
of available styles and flags, see the ButtonStyle command.  Examples:
.EX
ButtonStyle 1 Pixmap led.xpm -- Top Left
ButtonStyle 1 ActiveDown HGradient 8 grey \\
  black
ButtonStyle All --  UseTitleStyle
AddButtonStyle 1 ActiveUp (Pixmap a.xpm)  \\
  ActiveDown (Pixmap b.xpm -- Top)
AddButtonStyle 1 Vector 4 50x30@1 70x70@0 \\
  30x70@0 50x30@1
.EE
Initially for this example all button states are set to a pixmap.  The
second line replaces the ActiveDown state with a gradient (it
overrides the pixmap assigned to it in the line before, which assigned
the same style to every state).  Then, the UseTitleStyle flag is set
for all buttons, which causes \fIfvwm\fP to draw any styles set with
TitleStyle before drawing the buttons.  Finally, AddButtonStyle is
used to place additional pixmaps for both ActiveUp and ActiveDown
states and a Vector button style is drawn on top of all state.


.IP "AddTitleStyle [ \fIstate\fP ] [ \fIstyle\fP ] [ -- \fI[!]flag ...\fP ]"
Adds a title style to the title bar.  \fIstate\fP should be one of
"ActiveUp," "ActiveDown," or "Inactive."  If \fIstate\fP is omitted,
then the style is added to every state.  If the style and flags are
enclosed in parentheses, then multiple state definitions can be placed
on a single line.  This command is quite similar to the AddButtonStyle
command (see above).

Title bars are drawn in the order of definition, beginning with the
most recent TitleStyle, followed by those added with AddTitleStyle.
To clear the title style stack, change style flags, or for the
descriptions of available styles and flags, see the TitleStyle and
ButtonStyle commands.


.IP "AddToDecor \fIdecor\fP"
Add or divert commands to the decor named \fIdecor\fP.  A decor is a
name given to the set of commands which affect button styles,
title-bar styles, border styles, hilight colors, and window fonts.  If
\fIdecor\fP does not exist it is created; otherwise the existing
\fIdecor\fP is modified.

Created decors start out exactly like the default fvwm decor without
any style definitions.  A given decor may be applied to a set of
windows with the UseDecor option of the Style command.  Modifying an
existing decor will affect windows which are currently assigned to it.

AddToDecor is similar in usage to the AddToMenu and AddToFunc
commands, except that menus and functions are replaced by ButtonStyle,
AddButtonStyle, TitleStyle, AddTitleStyle, BorderStyle, HilightColor
and WindowFont commands.  Decors created with AddToDecor can be
manipulated with ChangeDecor, DestroyDecor, UpdateDecor, and the
UseDecor Style option.

The following example creates a decor and style, both named
"flatness."  Despite having the same name, they are distinct entities:
.EX
AddToDecor flatness
 + ButtonStyle All ActiveUp (-- flat) \\
   Inactive (-- flat)
 + TitleStyle -- flat
 + BorderStyle -- HiddenHandles NoInset
 + HilightColor white navy
Style "flatness" UseDecor flatness, \\
  Color white/grey40,HandleWidth 4

Style "xterm" UseStyle flatness
.EE
An existing window's decor may be reassigned with ChangeDecor, or a
Style command followed by a Recapture.  The decorations of all windows
or of a specific decor can be updated with UpdateDecor (useful after
decorations are modified; changing Style options requires a Recapture
instead).  A decor can be destroyed with DestroyDecor.


.IP "AddToFunc [ \fIname\fP [ \fItrigger\fP \fIaction\fP] ]"
Begins or add to a function definition.  Here's an example:
.EX
AddToFunc Move-or-Raise "I" Raise
 + "M" Move
 + "D" Lower
.EE
The function name is Move-or-Raise, and could be invoked from a menu
or a mouse binding or key binding:
.EX
Mouse 1 TS A Move-or-Raise
.EE
The quoted portion of the function tells what kind of action will
trigger the command which follows it.  "I" stands for Immediate, and is
executed as soon as the function is invoked.  "M" stands for Motion, i.e.
if the user starts moving the mouse.  "C" stands for Click, i.e., if the
user presses and releases the mouse in a short period of time
(ClickTime milliseconds).  "D" stands for double-click.  The action "I"
will cause an action to be performed on the button-press, if the
function is invoked with prior knowledge of which window to act on.

The special symbols $d, $w and $0 through $9 are available in the
ComplexFunctions or Macros, or whatever you want to call them.  Within
a macro, $w is expanded to the window-id (expressed in
hex, i.e. 0x10023c) of the window for which the macro was called
and $d is expanded to the current desk number. $0
through $9 are the arguments to the macro, so if you call
.EX
Key F10 R A Function MailFunction \\
  xmh "-font fixed"
.EE
and MailFunction is

.EX
AddToFunc MailFunction
 + "I" Next [$0] Iconify -1
 + "I" Next [$0] focus
 + "I" None [$0] Exec exec $0 $1
.EE
Then the last line of the function becomes
.EX
 + "I" None [xmh] Exec exec xmh -font fixed
.EE
The expansion is performed as the function is executed, so you can use the
same function with all sorts of different arguments.  I could use
.EX
Key F11 R A Function MailFunction \\
  zmail "-bg pink"
.EE
in the same .fvwm2rc, if I wanted.  An example of using $w is:
.EX
AddToFunc PrintFunction
 + "I" Raise
 + "I" Exec xdpr -id $w
.EE
Note that $$ is expanded to $.


.IP "AddToMenu \fImenu-name\fP [ \fImenu-label\fP \fIaction\fP ]"
Begins or adds to a menu definition.  Typically a menu definition looks
like this:
.EX
AddToMenu Utilities "Utilities" Title
 + "Xterm"         Exec  exec xterm -e tcsh
 + "Rxvt"          Exec  exec rxvt
 + "Remote Logins" Popup Remote-Logins
 + "Top"           Exec  exec rxvt -T Top -n \\
                   Top -e top
 + "Calculator"    Exec  exec xcalc
 + "Xman"          Exec  exec xman
 + "Xmag"          Exec  exec xmag
 + "emacs"         Exec  exec xemacs
 + "Mail"          MailFunction \\
                   xmh "-font fixed"
 + ""              Nop
 + "Modules"       Popup Module-Popup
 + ""              Nop
 + "Exit Fvwm"     Popup Quit-Verify
.EE
The menu could be invoked via
.EX
Mouse 1 R A Menu Utilities Nop
.EE
or
.EX
Mouse 1 R A Popup Utilities
.EE
There is no end-of-menu symbol.  Menus do not have to be defined in a
contiguous region of the .fvwm2rc file.  The quoted portion in the
above examples is the menu-label, which will appear in the menu when
the user pops it up.  The remaining portion is a built-in command
which should be executed if the user selects that menu item.  An empty
menu-label ("") and the Nop function can be used to insert a separator
into the menu.

Titles can be used within the menu. If you add the option "top" behind
the keyword "Title", the title will be added to the top of the menu.
If there was a title already, it is overwritten.

.EX
AddToMenu Utilities "Tools" Title top
.EE

All text up to the first TAB in the menu label is aligned to the
left side of the menu, all text right of the first TAB is aligned
to the right side. All other TABs are replaced by spaces.

If the menu-label contains an ampersand ('&'), the next character
is taken as a hotkey for the menu item. Hotkeys are underlined in
the label. To get a literal '&', insert '&&'.

If the menu-label contains a sub-string which is set off by stars,
then the text between the stars is expected to be the name of an
xpm-icon or bitmap-file to insert in the menu.  To get a literal '*',
insert '**'.For example
.EX
 + "Calculator*xcalc.xpm*" Exec exec xcalc
.EE
inserts a menu item labeled "calculator" with a picture of a
calculator above it.  The following:
.EX
 + "*xcalc.xpm*"           Exec exec xcalc
.EE
Omits the "Calculator" label, but leaves the picture.

If the menu-label contains a sub-string which is set off by percent signs,
then the text between the percent signs is expected to be the name of an
xpm-icon or bitmap-file to insert to the left of the menu label.
To get a literal '%', insert '%%'. For example
.EX
 + "Calculator%xcalc.xpm%" Exec exec xcalc
.EE
inserts a menu item labeled "calculator" with a picture of a
calculator to the left.  The following:
.EX
 + "%xcalc.xpm%"           Exec exec xcalc
.EE
Omits the "Calculator" label, but leaves the picture.  The pictures
used with this feature should be small (perhaps 16x16).

If the menu-name (not the label) contains a sub-string which is set
off by at signs ("@"), then the text between them is expected to be
the name of an xpm or bitmap file to draw along the left side of the
menu (a "side pixmap"). You will probably want to use the SidePic
option of the \fIMenuStyle\fP command instead.  To get a literal '@',
insert '@@'.  For example
.EX
AddToMenu "StartMenu@linux-menu.xpm@"
.EE
creates a menu with a picture in its bottom left corner.

If the menu-name contains also a sub-string set of by '^'s, then the
text between '^'s is expected to be the name a of X11 color and the
column containing the side picture will be colorized with that
color. You can set this color for a menu style using the SideColor
option of the \fIMenuStyle\fP command.  To get a literal '^', insert
'^^'.  Example:
.EX
AddToMenu "StartMenu@linux-menu.xpm@^blue^"
.EE
creates a menu with a picture in its bottom left corner and colorizes
with blue the region of the menu containing the picture.

In all the above cases, the name of the resulting menu is name specified,
stripped of the substrings between the various delimiters.


.IP "AnimatedMove \fIx y\fP [ \fIWarp\fP ]"

Move a window in an animated way. Similar to Move command, below.
Options are the same, except they are required, since it doesn't make
sense to have a user move the window interactively and animatedly. If
the optional argument \fIWarp\fP is specified the pointer is warped with
the window.


.IP "Beep"
As might be expected, this makes the terminal beep.


.IP "BorderStyle [ \fIstate\fP ] [ \fIstyle\fP ] [ -- \fI[!]flag ...\fP ]"
Defines a border style for windows.  \fIstate\fP can be either
"Active" or "Inactive."  If \fIstate\fP is omitted, then the style is
set for both states.  If the style and flags are enclosed in
parentheses, then multiple state definitions can be specified per
line.

\fIstyle\fP is a subset of the available ButtonStyles, and can only be
TiledPixmap (uniform pixmaps which match the bevel colors work best
this way).  If an "!"  is prefixed to any flag, flag behavior is
negated.  If \fIstyle\fP is not specified, then one can change flags
without resetting the style.

The "HiddenHandles" flag hides the corner handle dividing lines on
windows with handles (this option has no effect for NoHandle windows).
By default, HiddenHandles is disabled.

The "NoInset" flag supplements HiddenHandles.  If given, the inner
bevel around the window frame is not drawn.  If HiddenHandles is not
specified, this flag has no effect.

To decorate the active and inactive window borders with a textured
pixmap, one might specify:
.EX
BorderStyle Active TiledPixmap marble.xpm
BorderStyle Inactive TiledPixmap granite.xpm
BorderStyle Active -- HiddenHandles NoInset
.EE
To clear the style for both states:
.EX
BorderStyle Simple
.EE
To clear for a single state:
.EX
BorderStyle Active Simple
.EE
To unset a flag for a given state:
.EX
BorderStyle Inactive -- !NoInset
.EE
Title-bar buttons can inherit the border style with the UseBorderStyle
flag (see ButtonStyle).


.IP "ButtonStyle \fIbutton\fP [ \fIstate\fP ] [ \fIstyle\fP ] [ -- \fI[!]flag ...\fP ]"
Sets the button style for a title-bar button.  \fIbutton\fP is the
title-bar button number between 0 and 9, or one of "All," "Left,"
"Right," or "Reset."  Button numbering is described in the Mouse
section (see below).  If the style and flags are enclosed in
parentheses, then multiple state definitions can be specified per
line.

\fIstate\fP refers to which button state should be set.  Button states
are defined as follows: "ActiveUp" and "ActiveDown" refer to the
unpressed and pressed states for buttons on active windows; while the
"Inactive" state denotes buttons on inactive windows.

If \fIstate\fP is ActiveUp, ActiveDown, or Inactive, that particular
button state is set.  If \fIstate\fP is omitted, every state is set.
Specifying a style destroys the current style (use AddButtonStyle to
avoid this).

If \fIstyle\fP is omitted, then state-dependent flags can be set for
the primary button style without destroying the current style.
Examples (each line should be considered independent):
.EX
ButtonStyle Left -- flat
ButtonStyle All ActiveUp (-- flat) \\
  Inactive (-- flat)
.EE
The first line sets every state of the left buttons to flat, while the
second sets only the ActiveUp and Inactive states of every button to
flat (only flags are changed; the buttons' individual styles are not
changed).

If you want to reset all buttons to their defaults:
.EX
ButtonStyle Reset
.EE
To reset the ActiveUp button state of button 1 to the default:
.EX
ButtonStyle 1 ActiveUp Default
.EE
To reset all button states of button 1 to the default of
button number 2:
.EX
ButtonStyle 1 Default 2
.EE

For any given button, multiple state definitions can be given on one
line by enclosing the style and flags in parentheses.  If only one
definition per line is given the parentheses can be omitted.

\fIflags\fP affect the specified \fIstate\fP.  If an "!" is prefixed
to any \fIflag\fP, its behavior is negated.  The available
state-dependent flags for all styles are described here (the next
ButtonStyle entry deals with state-independent flags).

"Raised" causes a raised relief pattern to be drawn.

"Sunk" causes a sunken relief pattern to be drawn.

"Flat" inhibits the relief pattern from being drawn.

"UseTitleStyle" causes the given button state to render the current
title style before rendering the button's own styles.  The Raised,
Flat, and Sunk TitleStyle flags are ignored since they are redundant
in this context.

"UseBorderStyle" causes the button to inherit the decorated
BorderStyle options.

Raised, Sunk, and Flat are mutually exclusive, and can be specified
for the initial ButtonStyle only.  UseTitleStyle and UseBorderStyle
are also mutually exclusive (both can be off however).  The default is
Raised with both UseBorderStyle and UseTitleStyle left unset.

There is an \fBimportant note\fP for the ActiveDown state.  When a
button is pressed, the relief is inverted.  Because of this, to obtain
a sunken ActiveDown state you must specify the opposite of the desired
relief (i.e. to obtain a pressed-in look which is raised, specify Sunk
for ActiveDown).  This behavior is consistent, but may seem confusing
at first.

Button styles are classified as non-destructive, partially destructive,
or fully destructive.  Non-destructive styles do not affect the image.
Partially destructive styles can obscure some or all parts of the
underlying image (i.e. Pixmap).  Fully destructive styles obscure the
entire underlying image (i.e. Solid or one of the gradient styles).
Thus, if stacking styles with AddButtonStyle (or AddTitleStyle for
title bars), use care in sequencing styles to minimize redraw.

The available styles and their arguments now follow (depending on
compilation options, some button styles may be unavailable).

The "Simple" style does nothing.  There are no arguments, and this
style is an example of a non-destructive button style.

The "Default" style conditionally accepts one argument: a number which
specifies the default button number to load.  If the style command
given is ButtonStyle or AddButtonStyle, the argument is optional (if
given, will override the current button).  If a command other than
ButtonStyle or AddButtonStyle is used, the number must be specified.

The "Solid" style fills the button with a solid color.  The relief
border color is not affected.  The color should be specified as a
single argument.  This style is fully destructive.

The "Vector" style draws a line pattern.  Since this is a standard
button style, the keyword "Vector" is optional.  The specification is
a little cumbersome:
.EX
ButtonStyle 2 Vector 4 50x30@1 70x70@0 \\
  30x70@0 50x30@1
.EE
then the button 2 decoration will use a 4-point pattern consisting of
a line from (x=50,y=30) to (70,70) in the shadow color (@0), and then
to (30,70) in the shadow color, and finally to (50,30) in the
highlight color (@1).  Is that too confusing? See the sample .fvwm2rc
for a few examples.  This style is partially destructive.

The "VGradient" and "HGradient" styles denote gradient styles.  The H
and V prefixes denote both horizontal and vertical directions.

This style has two forms:

.in +2
The first form specifies a linear gradient.  Arguments: total number
of colors to allocate (between 2 and 128), the initial color, and the
final color.

The second form specifies a nonlinear gradient.  Arguments: total
number of colors to allocate (between 2 and 128), then the number of
segments.  For each segment, specify the starting color, percentage to
increment, then ending color.  Each subsequent segment begins with the
color of the last segment.  All of the percentages must add up to 100.
.in -2

Example:
.EX
TitleStyle VGradient 16 3 Red 20 Blue 30 \\
  Black 50 Grey
.EE
The gradient styles are fully destructive.

The "Pixmap" style displays a pixmap.  A pixmap should be specified as
an argument.  For example, the following would give button 2 the same
pixmap for both states, and button 4 different pixmaps for the up,
down and inactive states.
.EX
ButtonStyle 2 Pixmap my_pixmap.xpm
ButtonStyle 4 ActiveUp (Pixmap up.xpm) \\
  ActiveDown (Pixmap down.xpm)
ButtonStyle 4 Inactive Pixmap inactive.xpm
.EE
The pixmap specification can be given as an absolute or relative
pathname (see PixmapPath).  If the pixmap cannot be found, the button
style reverts to Simple.  Flags specific to the Pixmap style are
"Left," "Right," "Top," and "Bottom."  These can be used to justify
the pixmap (default is centered for both directions).  Pixmap
transparency is used for the color "None."  This style is partially
destructive.

The "MiniIcon" style draws the window's miniature icon in the button,
which is specified with the MiniIcon option of the Style command. This
button style accepts no arguments.  Example:
.EX
Style "*"     MiniIcon mini-bx2.xpm
Style "xterm" MiniIcon mini-term.xpm
Style "Emacs" MiniIcon mini-doc.xpm

ButtonStyle 1 MiniIcon
.EE

The "TiledPixmap" style accepts a pixmap to be tiled as the button
background.  One pixmap is specified as an argument.  Pixmap
transparency is not used.  This style is fully destructive.


.IP "ButtonStyle \fIbutton\fP - \fI[!]flag ...\fP"
Sets state-independent flags for the specified \fIbutton\fP.
State-independent flags affect button behavior.  Each flag is
separated by a space.  If an "!" is prefixed to the flag then the flag
behavior is negated.  The special flag "Clear" clears any existing
flags.

The following flags are usually used to tell fvwm which buttons should
be affected by MWM function hints.  This is not done automatically
since you might have buttons bound to complex functions, for instance.

"MWMDecorMenu" should be assigned to title bar buttons which display a
menu.  The default assignment is the leftmost button.  When a window
with the MWMFunctions Style option requests not to show this button,
it will be hidden.

"MWMDecorMin" should be assigned to title bar buttons which minimize
or iconify the window.  The default assignment is the second button
over from the rightmost button.  When a window with the MWMFunctions
Style option requests not to show this button, it will be hidden.

"MWMDecorMax" should be assigned to title bar buttons which maximize
the window.  The default assignment is the rightmost button.  When a
window with the MWMFunctions Style option requests not to show this
button, it will be hidden.


.IP "ChangeDecor \fIdecor\fP"
Changes the decor of a window to \fIdecor\fP.  \fIdecor\fP is
"Default," or the name of a decor defined with AddToDecor.  If
\fIdecor\fP is invalid, nothing occurs.  If called from somewhere in a
window or its border, then that window is affected.  If called from
the root window the user will be allowed to select the target window.
ChangeDecor only affects attributes which can be set using the
AddToDecor command.
.EX
ChangeDecor "CustomDecor1"
.EE

.IP "ChangeMenuStyle \fImenustyle menu ...\fP"
Changes the menu style of "menu" to "menustyle", you may specified more
than one menu in each \fIChangeMenuStyle\fP.
.EX
ChangeMenuStyle  pixmap1 Screensavers ScreenLock
.EE

.IP "ClickTime [ \fIdelay\fP ]"
Specifies the maximum delay (in milliseconds) between a button press
and a button release for the Function built-in to consider the action
a mouse click.  The default delay is 150 milliseconds.  Omitting the
delay value resets the ClickTime to the default.


.IP "Close"
If the window accepts the delete window protocol a message is sent to
the window asking it to gracefully remove itself.  If the window does
not understand the delete window protocol then the window is
destroyed.


.IP "ColorLimit \fIlimit\fP"
Specifies a limit  on the colors used in  pixmaps used  by fvwm.  Zero
(the   default)  sets no     limit.   Fvwm uses  pixmaps  for  icons,
mini-icons, and pixmap borders and titles.  This command limits pixmap
colors  to a set  of colors that  starts out with  common colors.  The
current  list contains about 60 colors  and  starts with white, black,
grey,   green,  blue, red, cyan,  yellow,  and   magenta.  The command
"ColorLimit 9" would limit pixmaps to these 9 colors.

It makes the most sense to put this command at the front of the
.fvwm2rc  file.  This   command should  be   before any  menu
definitions that contain mini-icons.

Solid frame and title colors (including shadows and gradients) are not
controlled by this command.


.IP "ColormapFocus \fIFollowsMouse\fP|\fIFollowsFocus\fP"
By default, fvwm installs the colormap of the window that the cursor
is in.  If you use ColormapFocus FollowsFocus, then the installed
colormap will be the one for the window that currently has the
keyboard focus.


.IP "Current (\fIconditions\fP) \fIcommand\fP"
Performs \fIcommand\fP on the current window if it satisfies all
\fIconditions\fP.  Conditions include "Iconic", "!Iconic", "Visible",
"!Visible", "Sticky", "!Sticky", "Maximized", "!Maximized",
"Transient", "!Transient", "Raised", "!Raised", "CurrentDesk",
"CurrentPage", and "CurrentPageAnyDesk".  In addition, the condition
may include a window name to match to.  The window name may include
the wildcards * and ?.  The window name, icon name, class, and
resource will be considered when attempting to find a match.  The
window name can begin with ! which will prevent \fIcommand\fP if any
of the window name, icon name, class or resource match.

Note that earlier versions of fvwm2 required the conditions to be
enclosed in brackets instead of parentheses (this is still supported
for backwards compatibility).


.IP "CursorMove \fIhorizontal vertical\fP"
Moves the mouse pointer by \fIhorizontal\fP pages in the X direction
and \fIvertical\fP pages in the Y direction.  Either or both entries
may be negative.  Both horizontal and vertical values are expressed in
percent of pages, so "CursorMove 100 100" means to move down and right
by one full page.  "CursorMove 50 25" means to move right half a page
and down a quarter of a page.  Alternatively, the distance can be
specified in pixels by appending a 'p' to the horizontal and/or vertical
specification.  For example "CursorMove -10p -10p" means move ten
pixels up and ten pixels left.  The CursorMove function should not be
called from pop-up menus.

.IP "CursorStyle \fIcontext cursornum\fP"
Defines a new cursor for the specified context.  The various contexts
are:

.in +.5i
POSITION (XC_top_left_corner)
.in +.3i
used when initially placing windows
.in -.3i

TITLE (XC_top_left_arrow)
.in +.3i
used in a window title-bar

DEFAULT (XC_top_left_arrow)
.in +.3i
used in windows that don't set their cursor
.in -.3i

SYS (XC_hand2)
.in +.3i

.in +.3i
used in the bottom side-bar of a window
.in -.3i

LEFT (XC_left_side)
.in +.3i
used in the left side-bar of a window
.in -.3i

TOP_LEFT (XC_top_left_corner)
.in +.3i
used in the top left corner of a window
.in -.3i

TOP_RIGHT (XC_top_right_corner)
.in +.3i
used in the top right corner of a window
.in -.3i

BOTTOM_LEFT (XC_bottom_left_corner)

used in the bottom left corner of a window
.in -.3i

BOTTOM_RIGHT (XC_bottom_right_corner)
.in +.3i
used in the bottom right corner of a window
.in -.3i
.in -.5i

And the cursornum is the numeric value of the cursor as defined in the
include file X11/cursorfont.h.  An example:
.EX
# make the kill cursor be XC_gumby:
CursorStyle DESTROY 56
.EE
The defaults are shown in parenthesis above.


.IP "DefaultColors [ \fI foreground background\fP ]"
\fIDefaultColors\fP sets the default forground and background
colors used in miscellaneous windows created by fvwm, for example
in the geometry feedback windows during a move or resize operation.
If you don't want to change one color or the other, use - as its
color name. To revert to the builtin default colors omit both
color names. Note that the default colors are not used in menus,
window titles or icon titles.


.IP "DefaultFont [ \fIfontname\fP ]"
\fIDefaultFont\fP sets the default font to font \fIfontname\fP.
The default font is used by fvwm2 whenever no other font has been
specified. To reset the default font to the built in default, omit
the argument. The default font is used for menus, window titles,
icon titles as well as the geometry feedback windows during a move
or resize operation. To override the default font in a specific
context, use the \fIWindowFont\fP, \fIIconFont\fP or \fIMenuStyle\fP
commands.


.IP "Delete"
Sends a message to a window asking that it remove itself, frequently
causing the application to exit.


.IP "Desk \fIarg1\fP [ \fIarg2\fP ] [ \fImin max\fP ]"
Switches the current viewport to another desktop (workspace, room).

The command takes 1, 2, 3, or 4 arguments. A single argument is
interpreted as a relative desk number. Two arguments are understood
as a relative and an absolute desk number. Three arguments specify
a relative desk and the minimum and maximum of the allowable range.
Four arguments specify the relative, absolute, minimum and maximum
values. (Desktop numbers can be negative.)

If \fIarg1\fP is non zero then the next desktop number will be the
current desktop number plus \fIarg1\fP.

If \fIarg1\fP is zero then the new desktop number will be \fIarg2\fP.
(If \fIarg2\fP is not present, then the command has no effect.)

If \fImin\fP and \fImax\fP are given, the new desktop number will
be no smaller than min and no bigger than max. Values out of this
range are truncated (if you gave an absolute desk number) or wrapped
around (if you gave a relative desk number).

The syntax is the same as for \fIMoveToDesk\fP, which moves a window
to a different desktop.

The number of active desktops is determined dynamically.  Only
desktops which contain windows or are currently being displayed are
active.  Desktop numbers must be between 2147483647 and -2147483648
(is that enough?).


.IP "DeskTopSize \fIHorizontal\fPx\fIVertical\fP"
Defines the virtual desktop size in units of the physical screen size.


.IP "Destroy"
Destroys an application window, which usually causes the application
to crash and burn.


.IP "DestroyDecor \fIdecor\fP"
Deletes the \fIdecor\fP defined with AddToDecor, so that subsequent
references to it are no longer valid.  Windows using this \fIdecor\fP
revert to the default fvwm decor.  The decor named "Default" cannot be
destroyed.
.EX
DestroyDecor "CustomDecor1"
.EE


.IP "DestroyFunc"
Deletes a function, so that subsequent references to it are no longer
valid.  You can use this to change the contents of a function during an
fvwm session.  The function can be rebuilt using AddToFunc.
.EX
DestroyFunc "PrintFunction"
.EE


.IP "DestroyMenu"
Deletes a menu, so that subsequent references to it are no longer
valid.  You can use this to change the contents of a menu during an
fvwm session.  The menu can be rebuilt using AddToMenu.
.EX
DestroyMenu "Utilities"
.EE

.IP "DestroyMenuStyle \fImenustyle\fP"
Deletes the menu style named "menustyle" and changes all menus using
this style to the default style, you cannot destroy the default menu.
.EX
DestroyMenuStyle pixamp1
.EE

.IP "DestroyModuleConfig"
Deletes module configuration entries, so that new configuration lines
may be entered instead.  You can use this to change the the way a
module runs during an fvwm session without restarting.  Wildcards can
be used for portions of the name as well.
.EX
DestroyModuleConfig FvwmFormFore
DestroyModuleConfig FvwmButtons*
.EE


.IP "Direction \fIdirection\fP (\fIconditions\fP) \fIcommand\fP"
Performs \fIcommand\fP (typically Focus) on a window in the given
direction which satisfies all \fIconditions\fP.  Conditions are the same
as for \fICurrent\fP. The \fIdirection\fP may be one of North, Northeast,
East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West and Northwest. Which window
Direction selects depends on angle and distance between the centerpoints
of the windows. Closer windows are considered a better match than
those farther away.


.IP "Echo \fIstring\fP"
Prints a message to stderr.  Potentially useful for debugging things
in your .fvwm2rc.
.EX
Echo Beginning style defs...
.EE


.IP "EdgeResistance \fIscrolling moving\fP"
Tells how hard it should be to change the desktop viewport by moving
the mouse over the edge of the screen and how hard it should be to
move a window over the edge of the screen.

The first parameter tells how milliseconds the pointer must spend on
the screen edge before \fIfvwm\fP will move the viewport.  This is
intended for people who use "EdgeScroll 100 100" but find themselves
accidentally flipping pages when they don't want to.

The second parameter tells how many pixels over the edge of the screen
a window's edge must move before it actually moves partially off the
screen. By default the viewport is moved a full page in the requested
direction, but if you used \fIEdgeScroll\fP and set any values other
than zero they will be used instead.

Note that, with "EdgeScroll 0 0", it is still possible to move or
resize windows across the edge of the current screen.  By making the
first parameter to EdgeResistance 10000 this type of motion is
impossible.  With EdgeResistance less than 10000 but greater than 0
moving over pages becomes difficult but not impossible.
See also, EdgeThickness.

.IP "EdgeScroll \fIhorizontal vertical\fP"
Specifies the percentage of a page to scroll when the cursor hits the
edge of a page.  A trailing "p" changes the interpretation to mean "pixels".
If you don't want any paging or scrolling when you hit the edge of a
page include "EdgeScroll 0 0" in your .fvwm2rc file,
or possibly better, set the EdgeThickness to zero.
See the EdgeThickness command. If you want whole
pages, use "EdgeScroll 100 100".  Both horizontal and vertical should
be positive numbers.

If the horizontal and vertical percentages are multiplied by 1000 then
scrolling will wrap around at the edge of the desktop.  If "EdgeScroll
100000 100000" is used \fIfvwm\fP will scroll by whole pages, wrapping
around at the edge of the desktop.

.IP "EdgeThickness \fI0\fP|\fI1\fP|\fI2\fP"
This is the width or height of the invisible window that fvwm2 creates
on the edges of the screen that are used for the edgescrolling feature.

A value of  zero completely disables  mouse edge scrolling, even while
dragging a window.

1 gives the  smallest pan frames,  which seem to  work best  except on
some servers.

2 is the default.

Pan frames of 1 or 2 pixels can sometimes be confusing, for example,
if you drag a window over the edge of the screen, so that it stradles
aa pan frame, clicks on the window, near the edge of the screen are
treated as clicks on the root window.

Right now, this logic is only good on the initial read of .fvwm2rc.
You may get undefined behavior if you issue this command after fvwm2 is
running.


.IP "Emulate \fIfvwm\fP|\fImwm\fP|\fIwin\fP"
This command affects how miscellaneous things are done by fvwm.
For example where the move/resize feedback window appears depends
on this command. To have more MWM- or WIN-like behavior you can call
Emulate with "MWM" or "WIN" as its argument.


.IP "Exec \fIcommand\fP"
Executes \fIcommand\fP.  You should not use an ampersand ``&'' at the
end of the command.  You probably want to use an additional ``exec'' at
the beginning of \fIcommand\fP.  Without that, the shell that fvwm
invokes to run your command will stay until the command exits.  In
effect, you'll have twice as many processes running as you need.
Note that some shells are smart enough to avoid this, but it never hurts
to include the ``exec'' anyway.

The following example binds function key F1 in the root window, with
no modifiers, to the exec function.  The program rxvt will be started
with an assortment of options.
.EX
Key F1 R N Exec exec rxvt -fg yellow -bg blue \\
  -e /bin/tcsh
.EE

Note that this function doesn't wait for \fIcommand\fP to complete, so
things like:
.EX
Exec "echo AddToMenu ... > /tmp/file"
Read /tmp/file
.EE
won't work reliably.

.IP "ExecUseShell [ \fIshell\fP ]"
Makes the Exec command use the specified shell, or the value of the
$SHELL environment variable if no shell is specified, instead of the
default Bourne shell (/bin/sh).
.EX
ExecUseShell
ExecUseShell /usr/local/bin/tcsh
.EE


.IP "FlipFocus"
Executes a \fIFocus\fP command as if the user had used the pointer to
select the window.  This command alters the order of the windowlist in
the same way as clicking in a window to focus, i.e. the target window is
removed from the windowlist and placed at the start. This command is
recommended for use with the \fIDirection\fP command and in the function
invoked from \fIWindowList\fP.


.IP "Focus"
Moves the viewport or window as needed to make the selected window
visible.  Sets the keyboard focus to the selected window.  Raises the
window if needed to make it visible.  Does not warp the pointer into
the selected window (see WarpToWindow function).  Does not de-iconify.
This command does not alter the order of the windowlist, it rotates the
windowlist around so that the target window is at the start.


.IP "Function \fI\FunctionName\\fP"
Used to bind a previously defined function to a key or mouse button.

The following example binds mouse button 1 to a function called
"Move-or-Raise", whose definition was provided as an example earlier
in this man page.  After performing this binding \fIfvwm\fP will
execute to move-or-raise function whenever button 1 is pressed in a
window title-bar.
.EX
Mouse 1 T A Function Move-or-Raise
.EE
The keyword "Function" may be omitted if "FunctionName" does not
coincide with an fvwm built-in function name


.IP "GlobalOpts [ \fIoptions\fP ]"
This is a TEMPORARY command used to set some global options which will
later be handled as Style parms (or options to Style parms).  It
currently handles the following:
SmartPlacementIsReallySmart/SmartPlacementIsNormal,
ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick/ClickToFocusPassesClick,
ClickToFocusDoesntRaise/ClickToFocusRaises,
MouseFocusClickDoesntRaise/MouseFocusClickRaises,
CaptureHonorsStartsOnPage/CaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage,
RecaptureHonorsStartsOnPage/RecaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage,
ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage/ActivePlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage,
NoStipledTitles/StipledTitles

Example:
.EX
GlobalOpts ClickToFocusDoesntPassClick, \\
  ClickToFocusDoesntRaise
.EE

RecaptureHonorsStartsOnPage causes a window to be placed according to, or
revert to, the StartsOnPage desk and page specification on Restart or
Recapture. RecaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage causes fvwm to respect the current
window position on Restart or Recapture. The default is
RecaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage.

CaptureHonorsStartsOnPage causes the initial capture (of an already
existing window) at startup to place the window according to the
StartsOnPage desk and page specification. CaptureIgnoresStartsOnPage
causes fvwm to ignore these settings (including StartsOnDesk) on
initial capture. The default is CaptureHonorsStartsOnPage.

ActivePlacementIgnoresStartsOnPage suppresses StartsOnPage or StartsOnDesk
placement in the event that both ActivePlacement and SkipMapping are in
effect when a window is created. This prevents you from interactively
placing a window and then wondering where it disappeared to, because it got
placed on a different desk or page. ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage
allows this to happen anyway. The option has no effect if SkipMapping is
not in effect, because fvwm will switch to the proper desk/page to perform
interactive placement. The default is ActivePlacementHonorsStartsOnPage,
which matches the way StartsOnDesk handled the situation.

.IP "GotoPage x y"
Moves the desktop viewport to page (x,y).  The upper left page is
(0,0), the upper right is (M,0), where M is one less than the current
number of horizontal pages specified in the DeskTopSize command.  The
lower left page is (0,N), and the lower right page is (M,N), where N
is the desktop's vertical size as specified in the DeskTopSize
command.  The GotoPage function should not be used in a pop-up menu.


.IP "HilightColor \fItextcolor backgroundcolor\fP"
Specifies the text and background colors for the decorations on the
window which currently has the keyboard focus.


.IP "IconFont [ \fIfontname\fP ]"
Makes \fIfvwm\fP use font \fIfontname\fP for icon labels. To reset
this font to the default font (see \fIDefaultFont\fP) you may omit
\fIfontname\fP.


.IP "Iconify [ \fIvalue\fP ]"
Iconifies a window if it is not already iconified or de-iconifies it
if it is already iconified.  If the optional argument \fIvalue\fP is
positive only iconification will be allowed.  If the optional
argument is negative only de-iconification will be allowed.


.IP "IconPath \fIpath\fP"
Specifies a colon separated list of full path names of directories
where bitmap (monochrome) icons can be found.  Each path should start
with a slash.  Environment variables can be used here as well (i.e.
$HOME or ${HOME}).

Note: if the FvwmM4 is used to parse your rc files, then \fIm4\fP may
want to mangle the word "include" which will frequently show up in the
IconPath or PixmapPath command.  To fix this add undefine(`include')
prior to the IconPath command, or better use the '-m4-prefix' option
to force all m4 directives to have a prefix of "m4_" (see the
\fIFvwmM4\fP man page).


.IP "Key \fIkeyname Context Modifiers Function\fP"
Binds a keyboard key to a specified \fIfvwm\fP built-in function, or
removes the binding if \fIFunction\fP is '-'.  Definition is the same
as for a mouse binding except that the mouse button number is replaced
with a key name.  The \fIkeyname\fP is one of the entries from
/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h, with the leading XK_ omitted.  The
\fIContext\fP and \fIModifiers\fP fields are defined as in the Mouse
binding. However, when you press a key the context window is the
window that has the keyboard focus. That is not necessarily the
same as the window the pointer is over (with SloppyFocus or
ClickToFocus).

The following example binds the built in window list to pop up when
Alt-Ctrl-Shift-F11 is hit, no matter where the mouse pointer is:
.EX
Key F11 A SCM WindowList
.EE

Binding a key to a title-bar button will not cause that button to
appear unless a mouse binding also exists.


.IP "KillModule \fIname\fP"
Causes the module which was invoked with name \fIname\fP to be killed.
\fIname\fP may include wild-cards.


.IP "Lower"
Allows the user to lower a window.


.IP "Maximize [ \fI horizontal vertical\fP ]"
Without its optional arguments Maximize causes the window to
alternately switch from a full-screen size to its normal size.

With the optional arguments horizontal and vertical, which are
expressed as percentage of a full screen, the user can control the new
size of the window.  If horizontal is greater than 0 then the
horizontal dimension of the window will be set to
horizontal*screen_width/100.  The vertical resizing is similar.  For
example, the following will add a title-bar button to switch a window
to the full vertical size of the screen:
.EX
Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 0 100
.EE
The following causes windows to be stretched to the full width:
.EX
Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 100 0
.EE
This makes a window that is half the screen size in each direction:
.EX
Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 50 50
.EE
Values larger than 100 can be used with caution.

If the letter "p" is appended to each coordinate (horizontal and/or
vertical), then the scroll amount will be measured in pixels.


.IP "Menu \fImenu-name\fP [ \fIposition\fP ] [ \fIdouble-click-action\fP ]"
Causes a previously defined menu to be popped up in a "sticky" manner.
That is, if the user invokes the menu with a click action instead of a
drag action, the menu will stay up.  The command
\fIdouble-click-action\fP will be invoked if the user double-clicks
(or hits the key rapidly twice if the menu is bound to a key) when
bringing the menu up.

Several other commands affect menu operation.  See \fIMenuStyle\fP
and \fISetAnimation\fP.  When in a menu, keyboard
shortcuts work as expected.  Cursor keystrokes are also allowed.
Specifically, Cursor-Down, Ctrl-N, and Ctrl-J all move to the next
item;  Cursor-Up, Ctrl-P, and Ctrl-K all move to the prior item;
Cursor-Left and Ctrl-B return to the prior menu;  Cursor-Right and
Ctrl-F popup the next menu; Ctrl-Cursor-Up and Ctrl-Cursor-Down move
up and down five items, respectively;  Shift-Cursor-Up and
Shift-Cursor-Down move to the first and last items, respectively; Enter
executes the current item; Escape exits the current sequence of menus.

The pointer will be warped to where it was when the menu was invoked if
it was both invoked and terminated with a keystroke.

The \fIposition\fP arguments allow to place the menu somewhere on the
screen, for example centered on the visible screen or above a title
bar.  Basically it works like this: you specify a \fIcontext-rectangle\fP
and an offset to this rectangle by which the upper left corner of the menu
is moved from the upper left corner of the rectangle.  The \fIposition\fP
arguments consist of several parts:
.EX
[ [context-rectangle] x y ] [ special-options ]
.EE
The \fIcontext-rectangle\fP can be one of:

.in +.5i
Root
.in +.3i
the root window.
.in -.3i
Mouse
.in +.3i
a 1x1 rectangle at the mouse position.
.in -.3i
Window
.in +.3i
the window with the focus.
.in -.3i
Interior
.in +.3i
the inside of the focused window.
.in -.3i
Title
.in +.3i
the title of the focused window or icon.
.in -.3i
Button<n>
.in +.3i
button #n of the focused window.
.in -.3i
Icon
.in +.3i
the focused icon.
.in -.3i
Menu
.in +.3i
the current menu.
.in -.3i
Item
.in +.3i
the current menu item.
.in -.3i
Context
.in +.3i
the current window, menu or icon.
.in -.3i
This
.in +.3i
whatever widget the pointer is on (e.g. a corner of a window or the root window).
.in -.3i
Rectangle <geometry>
.in +.3i
the rectangle defined by <\fIgeometry\fP> in X geometry format.  Width and height default to 1 if omitted.
.in -.3i
.in -.5i

If the context-rectangle is omitted "Mouse" is the default.
Note that not all of these make sense under all circumstances
(e.g. "Icon" if the pointer is on a menu).

The offset values \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP specify how far the menu is
moved from it's default position. By default, the numeric value given
is interpreted as a percentage of the context rectangle's width (height),
but with a trailing "m" the menu's width (height) is used instead.
Furthermore a trailing "p" changes the interpretation to mean "pixels".

Instead of a single value you can use a list of values. All additional
numbers after the first one are separated from threir predecessor but
their sign. Do not use any other separators.

If x or y are prefixed with 'o<number>' where <number> is an integer, the
menu and the rectangle will be moved to overlap at the specified position
before any other offsets are applied. The menu and the rectangle will be
placed so that the pixel at <number> percent of the rectangle's width/height
is right over the pixel at <number> percent of the menu's width/height.
So 'o0' means that the top/left borders of the menu and the rectangle
overlap, with 'o100' it's the bottom/right borders and if you use 'o50'
they are centered upon each other (try it and you will see it is much
simpler than this description). The default is 'o0'. The prefix
'o<number>' is an abbreviation for '+<number>-<number>m'.

A prefix of 'c' is equivalent of 'o50'.  Examples:

.EX
# window list in the middle of the screen
WindowList Root c c

# menu to the left of a window
Menu name window -100m c+0

# popup menu 8 pixels above the mouse pointer
Popup name mouse c -100m-8p

# somewhere on the screen
Menu name rectangle 512x384+1+1 +0 +0

# centered vertially around a menu item
AddToMenu foobar-menu
 + "first item" Nop
 + "special item" Popup "another menu" item \\
                  +100 c
 + "last item" Nop

# above the first menu item
AddToMenu foobar-menu
 + "first item" Popup "another menu" item +0 -100m
.EE
Note that you can put a submenu far off the current menu so you could
not reach it with the mouse without leaving the menu. If the pointer
leaves the current menu in the general direction of the submenu the
menu will stay up.

The \fIspecial-options\fP:

.in +.5i
The "animated" and "mwm" or "win" meny styles may move a menu somewhere
else on the screen.  If you do not want this you can add \fIFixed\fP
as an option. This might happen for example if you want the menu always
in the top right corner of the screen.

Where do you want a submenu to appear when you click on it's menu item?
The default is to place the title under the cursor, but if you want it
where the position arguments say, use the \fISelectInPlace\fP option.
If you want the pointer on the title of the menu, use \fISelectWarp\fP
too.

The pointer is warped to the title of a submenu whenever the pointer
would be on an item when the submenu is popped up ("fvwm" menu style) or
never warped to thetitle at all ("mwm" or "win" menu styles). You can
force (forbid) warping whenever the submenu is opened with the
\fIWarpTitle\fP (\fINoWarp\fP) option.

Note that the \fIspecial-options\fP do work with a normal menu that has
no other position arguments.
.in -.5i

.IP "MenuStyle \fIstylename options\fP"
Sets a new menu style or changes a previously defined style.
The \fIstylename\fP is the style name; if it contains spaces or tabs it
has to be quoted. The name "*" is reserved for the default menu style.
The default menu style is used for every menu-like object (e.g. the
window created by the \fIWindowList\fP command) that had not be assigned
a style using the \fIChangeMenuStyle\fP. See also \fIDestroyMenuStyle\fP.
When using monochrome color options are ignored.

\fIoptions\fP is a comma separated list containing some of the
keywords FVWM/MWM/WIN,
Foreground,
Background,
Greyed,
HilightBack/HilightBackOff,
ActiveFore/ActiveForeOff,
Hilight3DThick/Hilight3DThin/Hilight3DOff,
Animation/AnimationOff,
Font,
MenuFace,
PopupDelay,
PopupOffset,
TitleWarp/TitleWarpOff,
TitleUnderlines0/TitleUnderlines1/TitleUnderlines2,
SeparatorsLong/SeparatorsShort,
TrianglesSolid/TrianglesRelief,
PopupImmediately/PopupDelayed,
DoubleClickTime,
SidePic,
SideColor.

In the above list some options are listed as option pairs or triples
with a / in between. These options exclude each other.

\fIFVWM\fP, \fIMWM\fP, \fIWIN\fP reset all options to the style with
the same name in former versions of fvwm2. The default for new menu
styles is FVWM style. These options override all others except
Foreground, Background, Greyed, HilightBack, HilightFore and
PopupDelay, so they should be used only as the first option
specified for a menu style or to reset the style to defined bahavior.
The same effect can be created by setting all the other options one
by one.

\fIMWM\fP and \fIWIN\fP style menus popup sub-menus automatically.
WIN menus indicate the current menu item by changing the
background to dark. \fIFVWM\fP sub-menus overlap the parent menu,
MWM and WIN style menus never overlap the parent menu.

\fIFVWM\fP style is equivalent to HilightBackOff, Hilight3DThin,
ActiveForeOff, AnimationOff, Font, MenuFace, PopupOffset 0 67, TitleWarp,
TitleUnderlines1, SeparatorsShort, TriangleRelief, PopupDelayed.

\fIMWM\fP style is equivalent to HilightBackOff, Hilight3DThick,
ActiveForeOff, AnimationOff, Font, MenuFace, PopupOffset -3 100,
TitleWarpOff, TitleUnderlines2, SeparatorsLong, TriangleRelief,
PopupImmediately.

\fIWIN\fP style is equivalent to HilightBack, Hilight3DOff,
ActiveForeOff, AnimationOff, Font, MenuFace, PopupOffset -5 100,
TitleWarpOff, TitleUnderlines1, SeparatorsShort, TriangleSolid,
PopupImmediately.

\fIForeground\fP and \fIBackground\fP may have a color name as an
argument. This color is used for menu text or the menu's background.
You can omit the color name to reset these colors to the built in default.

\fIGreyed\fP may have a color name as an argument. This color is the
one used to draw a menu-selection which is prohibited (or not
recommended) by the mwm-hints which an application has specified.
If the color is omitted the color of "greyed" menu entries is based
on the background color of the menu.

\fIHilightBack\fP and \fIHilightBackOff\fP switch hilighting the background
of the selected menu item on and off. A specific background color
may be used by providing the color name as an argument to
\fIHilightBack\fP. If you use this option without an argument the
color is based on the menu's background color.

\fIActiveFore\fP and \fIActiveForeOff\fP switch hilighting the foreground
of the selected menu item on and off. A specific foreground color
may be used by providing the color name as an argument to
ActiveFore. Omitting the color name has the same effet as
using ActiveForeOff.

\fIHilight3DThick\fP, \fIHilight3DThin\fP and \fIHilight3DOff\fP
determine if the selected menu item is hilighted with a 3D relief.
Thick reliefs are two pixels wide, thin reliefs are one pixel wide.

\fIAnimation\fP and \fIAnimationOff\fP turn menu animation on or off.
When animation is on, sub-menus that don't fit on the screen cause
the parent menu to be shifted to the left so the sub-menu can be seen.

\fIFont\fP takes a font name as an argument. If a font by this name
exists it is used for the text of all menu items. If it does not
exist or if the name is left blank the built in default is used.

\fIMenuFace\fP enforces a fancy background upon the menus. You can
use the same options for MenuFace as for ButtonStyle plus DGradient,
(top-left to down-right) and BGradient (down-left to top-right). See
\fIButtonStyle\fP for more info. If you use MenuFace without arguments
the style is reverted back to normal.

Some examples of MenuFaces are:

.EX
MenuFace DGradient 128 2 lightgrey 50 blue 50 white
MenuFace TiledPixmap texture10.xpm
MenuFace HGradient 128 2 Red 40 Maroon 60 White
MenuFace Solid Maroon
.EE

If you encounter performance problems with gradient backgrounds
you can try one or all of the following:

Turn Hilighting of the active menu item other than forground color
off:

.EX
MenuStyle <stylename> Hilight3DOff, HilightBackOff
MenuStyle ActiveFore <preferred color>
.EE

Make sure submenus do not overlap the parent menu. This can prevent
menus being redrawn every time a submenu pops up or down.

.EX
MenuStyle <stylename> PopupOffset 1 100
.EE

Run you X server with backing storage. If your Xserver is started
with the -bs option, turn it off. If not try the -wm option.

.EX
startx -- -wm
.EE

You may have to adapt this example to your system (e.g. if you
use xinit to start X).

\fIPopupDelay\fP requires one numeric argument. This value is the
delay in milliseconds before a sub-menu is popped up when the
pointer moves over a menu item that has a sub-menu. If the value
is zero no automatical pop up is done. If the argument is omitted
the built in default is used. Note that the popup delay has no
effect if the \fIPopupImmediately\fP option is used since sub-menus pop
up immediately then. The PopupDelay option should only be applied to the
default style ('*') since it is a global setting and affects all
menus.

\fIPopupImmediately\fP makes menu items with sub menus pop up it up as
soon as the pointer enters the item. The PopupDelay is ignored then.
If \fIPopupDelayed\fP is used fvwm2 looks at the \fIPopupDelay\fP option
if or when this automatic popup happens.

\fIPopupOffset\fP requires two integer arguments. Both values affect
where sub-menus are placed relative to the parent menu. If both
values are zero, the left edge of the sub-menu overlaps the left edge
of the parent menu. If the first value is non-zero the sub-menu is
shifted that many pixels to the right (or left if negative). If the
second value is non-zero the menu is moved by that many percent of
the parent menu's width to the right or left.

\fITitleWarp\fP and \fITitleWarpOff\fP affect if the pointer warps to
the menu title when a sub-menu is opened or not. Not that regardless of
this setting the pointer will not be warped if the menu does not pop up
under the pointer.

\fITitleUnderlines0\fP, \fITitleUnderlines1\fP and \fITitleUnderlines2\fP
specify how many lines are drawn below a menu title.

\fISeparatorsLong\fP and \fISeparatorsShort\fP set the length of
menu separators. Long separators run from the left edge all the
way to the right edge. Short separators leave a few pixels to
the edges of the menu.

\fITrianglesSolid\fP and \fITrianglesRelief\fP affect how the
small triangles for sub-menus is drawn. Solid triangles are
filled with a color while relief triangles are hollow.

\fIDoubleClickTime\fP requires one numeric argument. This value is the
time in milliseconds between two mouse clicks in a menu to be
considered as a double click. The default is 450 milliseconds.
If the argument is omitted the doucle click time is reset to this
default. The DoubleClickTime option should only be applied to the
default style ('*') since it is a global setting and affects all
menus.

\fISidePic\fP takes the name of an xpm or bitmap file as an argument.
The picture is drawn along the left side of the menu. The SidePic
option can be overridden by a menu specific side pixmap (see
\fIAddToMenu\fP). If the file name is omitted an existing side
pixmap is remove from the menu style.

\fISideColor\fP takes the name of an X11 color as an argument. This
color is used to colorize the column containing the side picture
(see above). The SideColor option can be overridden by a menu
specific side color (see \fIAddToMenu\fP). If the color name is
omitted the side color option is switched off.

Examples:

.EX
MenuStyle * mwm
MenuStyle * Foreground Black, Background gray40
MenuStyle * Greyed gray70, ActiveFore White
MenuStyle * HilightBackOff, Hilight3DOff
MenuStyle * Font lucidasanstypewriter-14
MenuStyle * MenuFace DGradient 64 darkgray MidnightBlue

MenuStyle gred mwm
MenuStyle gred Foreground Yellow, Background Maroon
MenuStyle gred Greyed Red, ActiveFore Red
MenuStyle gred HilightBackOff, Hilight3DOff
MenuStyle gred Font lucidasanstypewriter-12
MenuStyle gred MenuFace DGradient 64 Red Black
.EE

Note that all style options could be placed on a single line for each
style name.


.IP "MenuStyle \fIforecolor backcolor shadecolor font style\fP [ \fIanim\fP ]"
This is the old syntax of the MenuStyle command. It is obsolete and
may be removed in the future. Please use the new syntax as described
above.

Sets the menu style.  When using monochrome the colors are ignored.
The shade-color is the one used to draw a menu-selection which is
prohibited (or not recommended) by the mwm-hints which an application
has specified.  The style option is either "fvwm" "mwm" or "win",
which changes the appearance and operation of the menus
and where the feedback window appears during resizes and moves.

"mwm" and "win" style menus popup sub-menus automatically.
"win" menus indicate the current menu item by changing the
background to black.
"fvwm" sub-menus overlap the parent menu, "mwm" and "win" style menus
never overlap the parent menu.
"mwm" resize and move feedback windows are in the center of the
screen, instead of the upper left corner.

The "anim" option is either "anim" or blank.  When this option
is "anim", sub-menus that don't fit on the screen cause the parent menu
to be shifted to the left so the sub-menu can be seen.

See also \fISetAnimation\fP command.

.IP "Module \fIModuleName\fP"
Specifies a module which should be spawned during initialization.  At
the current time the available modules (included with fvwm) are
FvwmAnimate (fancy animation of (de)iconification) FvwmAudio (makes
sounds to go with window manager actions), FvwmAuto
(an auto raise module), FvwmBacker (to change the background when you
change desktops), FvwmBanner (to display a spiffy XPM), FvwmButtons
(brings up a customizable tool bar), FvwmCpp (to preprocess your .fvwm2rc
with cpp), FvwmEvent (trigger various actions by events), FvwmForm
(to bring up dialogs), FvwmIconBox (like the mwm IconBox), FvwmIconMan
(like the twm icon manager), FvwmIdent (to get window info), FvwmM4
(to preprocess your .fvwm2rc with m4), FvwmPager (a mini version of
the desktop), FvwmSave (saves the desktop state in .xinitrc style),
FvwmSaveDesk (saves the desktop state in fvwm commands), FvwmScroll
(puts scrollbars on any window), FvwmTalk (to interactively run fvwm
commands), and FvwmWinList (a window list), FvwmAnimate (produces
animation effects when a window is iconified or deiconifed).
.\" Note: The "Optional Module Name" description is missing.
These modules have their own man pages.  There are other modules out
on there as well.

Modules can be short lived transient programs or, like FvwmButtons,
can remain for the duration of the X session.  Modules will be
terminated by the window manager prior to restarts and quits, if
possible.  See the introductory section on modules.  The keyword
"module" may be omitted if \fIModuleName\fP is distinct from all
built-in and function names.


.IP "ModulePath"
Specifies a colon separated list of paths for \fIfvwm\fP to search
when looking for a module to load.  Individual directories do not need
trailing slashes.  Environment variables can be used here as well (i.e.
$HOME or ${HOME}).  The builtin module path is available via the
environment variable $FVWM_MODULEDIR.


.IP "Mouse \fIButton Context Modifiers Function\fP"
Defines a mouse binding, or removes the binding if \fIFunction\fP is
'-'. \fIButton\fP is the mouse button number.  If \fIButton\fP is
zero then any button will perform the specified function.
\fIContext\fP describes where the binding applies.  Valid contexts are
R for the root window, W for an application window, T for a window
title bar, S for a window side, top, or bottom bar, F for a window
frame (the corners), I for an Icon window, or 0 through 9 for
title-bar buttons, or any combination of these letters.  A is for any
context except for title-bar buttons.  For instance, a context of FST
will apply when the mouse is anywhere in a window's border except the
title-bar buttons.

\fIModifiers\fP is any combination of N for no modifiers, C for
control, S for shift, M for Meta, or A for any modifier.  For example,
a modifier of SM will apply when both the Meta and Shift keys are
down.  X11 modifiers mod1 through mod5 are represented as the digits
1 through 5.

\fIFunction\fP is one of \fIfvwm\fP's built-in functions.

The title bar buttons are numbered with odd numbered buttons on the
left side of the title bar and even numbers on the right.
Smaller-numbered buttons are displayed toward the outside of the
window while larger-numbered buttons appear toward the middle of the
window (0 is short for 10).  In summary, the buttons are numbered:
.EX
1 3 5 7 9    0 8 6 4 2
.EE
The highest odd numbered button which has an action bound to it
determines the number of buttons drawn on the left side of the title
bar.  The highest even number determines the number or right side
buttons which are drawn.  Actions can be bound to either mouse buttons
or keyboard keys.


.IP "Move [ \fIx y\fP [ \fIWarp\fP ] ]"
Allows the user to move a window.  If called from somewhere in a
window or its border, then that window will be moved.  If called from
the root window then the user will be allowed to select the target
window. If the optional argument \fIWarp\fP is specified the pointer is warped
with the window.

The operation can be aborted with Escape or by pressing any mouse button
(except button 1 which confirms the move).

If the optional arguments x and y are provided, then the window will
be moved immediately without user interaction.  Each argument can
specify an absolute or relative position from either the left (top) or
right (bottom) of the screen.  By default, the numeric value given is
interpreted as a percentage of the screen width (height), but a trailing
"p" changes the interpretation to mean "pixels".

Simple Examples:
.EX
# Interactive move
Mouse 1 T A Move
# Move window so top left is at (10%,10%)
Mouse 2 T A Move 10 10
# Move top left to (10pixels,10pixels)
Mouse 3 T A Move 10p 10p
.EE

More complex examples (these can be bound as actions to keystrokes,
etc.; only the command is shown, though):
.EX
# Move window so bottom right is at bottom
# right of screen
Move -0 -0

# Move window 5% to the right, and to the
# middle vertically
Move w+5 50

# Move window up 10 pixels, and so left edge
# is at x=40 pixels
Move 40p w-10p
.EE

See also the "AnimatedMove" command, above.


.IP "MoveToDesk \fIarg1\fP [ \fIarg2\fP ] [ \fImin max\fP ]"
Moves the selected window to another desktop (workspace, room).

The arguments are the same as for the \fIDesk\fP command. MoveToDesk
is a replacement for the old WindowsDesk command, which can no longer
be used.


.IP "MoveToPage [ \fIx y\fP ]"
Moves the selected window to another page (x,y). The upper left page is
(0,0), the upper right is (M,0), where M is one less than the current
number of horizontal pages specified in the DeskTopSize command.  The
lower left page is (0,N), and the lower right page is (M,N), where N
is the desktop's vertical size as specified in the DeskTopSize
command. If \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP are not given, the window is moved to
the current page (a window that has the focus but is off-screen can
be retrieved with this).


.IP "Next (\fIconditions\fP) \fIcommand\fP"
Performs \fIcommand\fP (typically Focus) on the next window which
satisfies all \fIconditions\fP.  Conditions are the same as for \fICurrent\fP
with the addition of CirculateHit which overrides the CirculateSkip style
attribute and CirculateHitIcon which overrides the CirculateSkipIcon style
attribute for iconified windows.


.IP "None (\fIconditions\fP) \fIcommand\fP"
Performs \fIcommand\fP if no window which satisfies all
\fIconditions\fP exists.  Conditions are the same as for \fINext\fP.


.IP "Nop"
Does nothing.  This is used to insert a blank line or separator in a
menu.  If the menu item specification is Nop " ", then a blank line is
inserted.  If it looks like Nop "", then a separator line is inserted.
Can also be used as the double-click action for Menu.


.IP "OpaqueMoveSize \fIpercentage\fP"
Tells \fIfvwm\fP the maximum size window with which opaque window
movement should be used.  The percentage is percent of the total
screen area.  With "OpaqueMoveSize 0" all windows will be moved using the
traditional rubber-band outline.  With "OpaqueMoveSize 100" all windows
will be move as solid windows.  The default is "OpaqueMoveSize 5", which
allows small windows to be moved in an opaque manner but large windows
are moved as rubber-bands.


.IP "PipeRead \fIcmd option\fP"
Causes fvwm to read commands output from the program named
\fIcmd\fP.  Useful for building up dynamic menu entries based on a
directories contents, for example.


.IP "PixmapPath \fIpath\fP"
Specifies a colon separated list of full path names of directories
where pixmap (color) icons can be found.  Each path should start with
a slash.  Environment variables can be used here as well (i.e.  $HOME

.IP "Popup \fIPopupName\fP [ \fIposition\fP ] [ \fIdefault-action\fP ]"
This built-in has two purposes: to bind a menu to a key or mouse
button, and to bind a sub-menu into a menu.  The formats for the two
purposes differ slightly.  The \fIposition\fP arguments are the same
as for \fIMenu\fP.  The command \fIdefault-action\fP will be invoked
if the user clicks a button to invoke the menu and releases it
immediately again (or hits the key rapidly twice if the menu is bound
to a key).

To bind a previously defined pop-up menu to a key or mouse button:
.sp
.in +.25i
The following example binds mouse buttons 2 and 3 to a pop-up called
"Window Ops".  The menu will pop up if the buttons 2 or 3 are pressed
in the window frame, side-bar, or title-bar, with no modifiers (none
of shift, control, or meta).
.EX
Mouse 2 FST N Popup "Window Ops"
Mouse 3 FST N Popup "Window Ops"
.EE
Pop-ups can be bound to keys through the use of the Key built in.
Pop-ups can be operated without using the mouse by binding to keys and
operating via the up arrow, down arrow, and enter keys.
.in -.25i
.sp
To bind a previously defined pop-up menu to another menu, for use as a
sub-menu:
.sp
.in +.25i
The following example defines a sub menu, "Quit-Verify" and binds it into a
main menu, called "RootMenu":
.EX
AddToMenu Quit-Verify

Popup differs from Menu in that pop-ups do not stay up if the user
simply clicks.  These are Twm style popup-menus, which are a little
hard on the wrist.  Menu provides Motif or Microsoft-Windows style
menus which will stay up on a click action.  See menu for an explanation
of the interactive behaviour of menus.


.IP "Prev (\fIconditions\fP) \fIcommand\fP"
Performs \fIcommand\fP (typically Focus) on the previous window which
satisfies all \fIconditions\fP.  Conditions are the same as for \fINext\fP.


.IP "Quit"
Exits fvwm, generally causing X to exit too.


.IP "QuitScreen"
Causes fvwm to stop managing the screen on which the command was issued.


.IP "Raise"
Allows the user to raise a window.


.IP "RaiseLower"
Alternately raises and lowers a window.


.IP "Read \fIfilename\fP [ \fIoption\fP ]"
Causes fvwm to read commands from the file named \fIfilename\fP.
If the option following the filename is "Quiet", no message is
produced if the file is not found.


.IP "Recapture"
Causes fvwm to recapture all of its windows.  This ensures that the
latest style parameters will be used.  The recapture operation is
visually disturbing.


.IP "Refresh"
Causes all windows on the screen to redraw themselves.


.IP "RefreshWindow"
Causes current (or chosen) window to redraw itself.


.IP "Resize [ \fIx y\fP ]"
Allows the user to resize a window.  If called from somewhere in a
window or its border, then that window will be resized.  If called from
the root window then the user will be allowed to select the target
window.

The operation can be aborted with Escape or by pressing any mouse button
(except button 1 which confirms the resize).

If the optional arguments x and y are provided, then the window will
be resized so that its dimensions are \fIx\fP by \fIy\fP).  The units
of x and y are percent-of-screen, unless a letter "p" is appended to
each coordinate, in which case the location is specified in pixels.


.IP "Restart  \fIWindowManagerName\fP "
Causes \fIfvwm\fP to restart itself if WindowManagerName is "fvwm2",
or to switch to an alternate window manager if WindowManagerName is
other than "fvwm2".  If the window manager is not in your default
search path, then you should use the full path name for
\fIWindowManagerName\fP.

This command should not have a trailing ampersand or any command line
arguments and should not make use of any environmental variables.  Of
the following examples, the first two are sure losers, but the third
is OK:
.EX
Key F1 R N Restart fvwm &
Key F1 R N Restart $(HOME)/bin/fvwm
Key F1 R N Restart /home/nation/bin/fvwm
.EE

.IP "Scroll \fIhorizonal vertical\fP"
Scrolls the virtual desktop's viewport by \fIhorizontal\fP pages in
the x-direction and \fIvertical\fP pages in the y-direction.  Either
or both entries may be negative.  Both horizontal and vertical values
are expressed in percent of pages, so "Scroll 100 100" means to scroll
down and left by one full page.  "Scroll 50 25" means to scroll left
half a page and down a quarter of a page.  The scroll function should
not be called from pop-up menus. Normally, scrolling stops at the edge
of the desktop.

If the horizontal and vertical percentages are multiplied by 1000 then
scrolling will wrap around at the edge of the desktop.  If "Scroll
100000 0" is executed over and over \fIfvwm\fP will move to the next
desktop page on each execution and will wrap around at the edge of the
desktop, so that every page is hit in turn.

If the letter "p" is appended to each coordinate (horizontal and/or
vertical), then the scroll amount will be measured in pixels.

.IP "SendToModule \fImodulename string\fP"
Sends an arbitrary string (no quotes required) to all modules matching
\fImodulename\fP, which may contain wildcards.  This only makes sense
if the module is set up to understand and deal with these strings
though...  Can be used for module to module communication, or
implementation of more complex commands in modules.

.IP "SetAnimation \fImilliseconds-delay\fP [ \fifractions-to-move-list\fP ]"
Sets the time between frames and the list of fractional offsets to
customize the animated moves of the \fIAnimatedMove\fP command and
the animation of menus (if the menu style is set to animated).  If
the \fIfractions-to-move-list\fP is omitted, only the time between frames
is altered.  The fractions-to-move-list specifies how far the window
should be offset at each successive frame as a fraction of the difference
between the starting location and the ending location.  e.g.:
.EX
SetAnimation 10 -.01 0 .01 .03 .08 .18 .3 \\
  .45 .6 .75 .85 .90 .94 .97 .99 1.0
.EE

Sets the delay between frames to 10ms, and sets the positions of the 16
frames of the animation motion.  Notice that negative values are allowed,
and in particular can be used to make the motion appear more cartoonish, by
briefly moving slightly in the opposite direction of the main motion.  The
above settings are the default.

.IP "SetEnv \fIvarname stringvalue\fP"
Set an environment variable to a new value, similar to shell's export
or setenv command.  The variable and its value are inherited by processes
started directly by fvwm2.  This can be especially useful in conjunction
with the FvwmM4 module; e.g.  "SetEnv height HEIGHT" will make the FvwmM4-set
variable "HEIGHT" usable by processes started by fvwm2 as the environment
variable "$height".  If \fIstringvalue\fP includes whitespace, you should
enclose it in quotes.


.IP "SnapAttraction \fIproximity\fP [ \fIbehavior\fP ]"
If during an interactive move the window (or icon) comes within \fIproximity\fP
pixels of another the window (or icon) will be moved to make the borders
adjoin. The default of -1 means that no snapping will happen.  A setting of
0 does indeed snap when the distance is zero pixels.  This is relevant when
the \fISnapGrid\fP command is used.

The \fIbehavior\fP argument is optional and may be set to one of the four
following values:

With \fIAll\fP both icons and windows snap to other windows and other
icons.

\fISameType\fP lets snap windows only to other windows and icons
only to other icons.

With \fIWindows\fP windows snap only to other windows.  Icons do not
snap.

Similarly with \fIIcons\fP icons snap to only other icons and
windows do not snap.

The default SnapAttraction setting for behavior is "All".

.IP "SnapGrid \fIx-grid-size y-grid-size\fP"
During an interactive move a window (or icon) will be positioned such that
its location (top left corner) will be coincindent with the nearest grid point.
The default \fIx-grid-size\fP and \fIy-grid-size\fP setting are both 1, which
is effectively no grid all.  An interactive move with both \fISnapGrid\fP
and \fISnapAttraction\fP in effect will result in the window being moved to be
adjacent to the nearest window border (if within snap proximity) or grid
position.  In other words, the window will move the shortest distance possible
to satisfy both \fISnapGrid\fP and \fISnapAttraction\fP.  Note that the X and
Y coordinates are not coupled.  For example, a window may snap to another window
on the X axis while snapping to a grid point on the Y axis.

.IP "Stick"
Makes a window sticky if it is not already sticky, or non-sticky if it
is already sticky.

.IP "Style \fIwindowname options\fP"
This command is intended to replace the old fvwm 1.xx global commands
NoBorder, NoTitle, StartsOnDesk, Sticky, StaysOnTop, Icon,
WindowListSkip, CirculateSkip, SuppressIcons, BoundaryWidth,
NoBoundaryWidth, StdForeColor, and StdBackColor with a single flexible
and comprehensive window(s) specific command.  This command is used to
set attributes of a window to values other than the default or to set
the window manager default styles.

\fIwindowname\fP can be a window's name, class, or resource string.
It can contain the wildcards * and/or ?, which are matched in the
usual Unix filename manner.  They are searched in the reverse order
stated, so that Style commands based on the name override or augment
those based on the class, which override or augment those based on the
resource string.

Note - windows that have no name (WM_NAME) are given a name of
"Untitled", and windows that don't have a class (WM_CLASS, res_class)
are given Class = "NoClass" and those that don't have a resource
(WM_CLASS, res_name) are given Resource = "NoResource".

\fIoptions\fP is a comma separated list containing some or all of the
keywords BorderWidth, HandleWidth, NoIcon/Icon, MiniIcon, IconBox,
IconGrid, IconFill,
NoTitle/Title, NoHandles/Handles, WindowListSkip/WindowListHit,
CirculateSkip/CirculateHit, StaysOnTop/StaysPut, Sticky/Slippery,
StartIconic/StartNormal, Color, ForeColor, BackColor,
StartsOnDesk/StartsOnPage/StartsAnyWhere, IconTitle/NoIconTitle,
MWMButtons/FvwmButtons, MWMBorder/FvwmBorder, MWMDecor/NoDecorHint,
MWMFunctions/NoFuncHint, HintOverride/NoOverride, NoButton/Button,
OLDecor/NoOLDecor, StickyIcon/SlipperyIcon,
SmartPlacement/DumbPlacement, RandomPlacement/ActivePlacement,
DecorateTransient/NakedTransient, SkipMapping/ShowMapping, UseDecor,
UseStyle, NoPPosition/UsePPosition, Lenience/NoLenience,
ClickToFocus/SloppyFocus/MouseFocus|FocusFollowsMouse.

In the above list some options are listed as
style-option/opposite-style-option.  The opposite-style-option for
entries that have them describes the \fIfvwm\fP default behavior and
can be used if you want to change the \fIfvwm\fP default behavior.

\fIDecorateTransient\fP causes transient windows, which are normally
left undecorated, to be given the usual \fIfvwm\fP decorations (title
bar, buttons, etc.). Note that some pop-up windows, such as the xterm
menus, are not managed by the window manager and still do not receive
decorations. \fINakedTransient\fP (the default) causes transient windows
not to be given the standard decorations.

\fIIcon\fP takes an (optional) unquoted string argument which is the icon
bitmap or pixmap to use.

\fIIconBox\fP takes four numeric arguments or an X11 geometry string:
.EX
IconBox l t r b
.EE
or
.EX
IconBox geometry
.EE

Where l is the left coordinate, t is the top, r is right and b is
bottom. Negative coordinates indicate distance from the right or
bottom of the screen.
Perhaps easier to use is an X11 Geometry string:
.EX
IconBox -80x200-1-1
.EE
Which would place an 80 by 240 pixel iconbox in the lower right hand
corner of the screen.
The iconbox is a region of the screen where fvwm
attempts to put icons for any matching window, as long as they do not
overlap other icons.
Multiple icon boxes can be defined as overflow areas.  When the first
icon box is filled, the second one is filled.  All the icon boxes for
one style must be defined in one command.  For example:
.EX
Style "*" IconBox -80x200-1-1, \\
          IconBox 1000x70-1-1
.EE

\fIIconGrid\fP takes 2 numeric arguments greater than zero.
.EX
IconGrid x y
.EE
Icons are placed in an icon box by stepping thru the icon box using
the x and y values for the icon grid, looking for a free space.
The default grid is 3 by 3 pixels which gives a tightly packed appearance.
To get a more regular appearance use a grid larger than your largest icon.
Currently there is no way to clip an icon to a maximum size.
An IconGrid definition must follow the IconBox definition that it
applies to:
.EX
Style "*" IconBox -80x240-1-1, IconGrid 90 90
.EE

\fIIconFill\fP takes 2 arguments.
.EX
IconFill Bottom Right
.EE
Icons are placed in an icon box by stepping thru the icon box using
these arguments to control the direction the box is filled in.
By default the direction is left to right, then top to bottom.
This would be expressed as:
.EX
IconFill left bottom
.EE
To fill an icon box in columns instead of rows, specify the
vertical direction (top or bottom) first.
The directions can be abbreviated or spelled out as follows: "t", "top",
"b", "bot", "bottom", "l", "lft", "left", "r", "rgt", "right".
An IconFill definition must follow the IconBox definition that it
applies to:
.EX
Style "*" IconBox -80x240-1-1, IconFill b r
.EE

\fIMiniIcon\fP specifies a pixmap to use as the miniature icon for the
window.  This miniature icon can be drawn in a title-bar button (see
ButtonStyle), and can be used by various fvwm modules (FvwmWinList,
FvwmIconMan, and FvwmTaskBar). It takes the name of a pixmap as an
argument.

\fIStartsOnDesk\fP takes a numeric argument which is the desktop number on
which the window should be initially placed.  Note that standard Xt
programs can also specify this via a resource (e.g. "-xrm '*Desk: 1'").

\fIStartsOnPage\fP takes 1, 2, or 3 numeric arguments. If one or three
arguments are givem, the first (or only) argument is the desktop number.  If
three arguments are given, the 2nd and 3rd arguments identify the x,y page
position on the virtual window. If two arguments are given, they specify the
page position, and indicate no desk preference. If only one argument is given,
StartsOnPage functions exactly like StartsOnDesk. For those standard Xt
programs which understand this usage, the starting desk/page can also be
specified via a resource (e.g., "-xrm 'Fvwm.Page: 1 0 2'").

StartsOnPage in conjunction with SkipMapping is a useful technique when you
want to start an app on some other page and continue with what you were
doing, rather than waiting for it to appear.

\fIStaysOnTop\fP makes the window always try to stay on top of the other
windows.  This might be handy for clocks or mailboxes that you would
always like to be visible.  If the window is explicitly lowered it
will not try to force its way back to the top until it is explicitly
raised.  StaysPut (the default) allows the window to be obscured and
stay that way.

\fIBorderWidth\fP takes a numeric argument which is the width of the border
to place the window if it does not have resize-handles.

\fIHandleWidth\fP takes a numeric argument which is the width of the border
to place the window if it does have resize-handles.

\fIButton\fP and \fINoButton\fP take a numeric argument which is the
number of the title-bar button which is to be included/omitted.

\fIStickyIcon\fP makes the window sticky when its iconified.  It will
deiconify on top the active desktop.

\fIMWMButtons\fP makes the Maximize button look pressed-in when the window
is maximized.  See the MWMButton flag in ButtonStyle for more
information.

\fIMWMBorder\fP makes the 3-D bevel more closely match mwm's.

\fIMWMDecor\fP makes fvwm attempt to recognize and respect the mwm
decoration hints that applications occasionally use.

\fIMWMFunctions\fP makes fvwm attempt to recognize and respect the mwm
prohibited operations hints that applications occasionally use.
HintOverride makes fvwm shade out operations that mwm would prohibit,
but it lets you perform the operation anyway.

\fIOLDecor\fP makes fvwm attempt to recognize and respect the olwm and olvwm
hints that many older XView and OLIT applications use.

\fIColor\fP takes two arguments.  The first is the window-label text color
and the second is the window decoration's normal background color.
The two colors are separated with a slash.  If the use of a slash
causes problems then the separate ForeColor and BackColor options can
be used.

\fIUseDecor\fP accepts one argument: the name of a decor created with
AddToDecor.  If UseDecor is not specified, the "Default" decor is
used.  Windows do not actually contain decors, but are always assigned
to one.  If the decor is later modified with AddToDecor, the changes
will be visible for all windows which are assigned to it.  The decor
for a window can be reassigned with ChangeDecor.

\fIUseStyle\fP takes one arg, which is the name of another style.  That way
you can have unrelated window names easily inherit similar traits
without retyping.  For example: 'Style "rxvt" UseStyle "XTerm"'.

\fISkipMapping\fP tells fvwm not to switch to the desk the window is on when
it gets mapped initially (useful with StartsOnDesk or StartsOnPage).

\fILenience\fP instructs fvwm to ignore the convention in the ICCCM which
states that if an application sets the input field of the wm_hints
structure to False, then it never wants the window manager to give it
the input focus.  The only application that I know of which needs this
is sxpm, and that is a silly bug with a trivial fix and has no overall
effect on the program anyway.  Rumor is that some older applications
have problems too.

\fIClickToFocus\fP instructs fvwm to give the focus to the window when it is
clicked in.  The default \fIMouseFocus\fP (or its alias
\fIFocusFollowsMouse\fP) tells fvwm to give the window the focus as soon as
the pointer enters the window, and take it away when the pointer leaves the
window. \fISloppyFocus\fP is similar, but doesn't give up the focus if the
pointer leaves the window to pass over the root window or a ClickToFocus
window (unless you click on it, that is), which makes it possible to
move the mouse out of the way without losing focus.

\fINoPPosition\fP instructs fvwm to ignore the PPosition field when adding
new windows.  Adherence to the PPosition field is required for some
applications, but if you don't have one of those its a real headache.

\fIRandomPlacement\fP causes windows which would normally require user
placement to be automatically placed in ever-so-slightly random
locations.  For the best of all possible worlds use both
RandomPlacement and SmartPlacement.

\fISmartPlacement\fP causes windows which would normally require user
placement to be automatically placed in a smart location - a location
in which they do not overlap any other windows on the screen.  If no
such position can be found user placement or random placement (if
specified) will be used as a fall-back method.  For the best of all
possible worlds use both RandomPlacement and SmartPlacement.

An example:
.EX
# Change default fvwm behavior to no title-
# bars on windows! Also define a default icon.
Style "*"           NoTitle,                 \\
                    Icon unknown1.xpm,       \\
                    BorderWidth 4,           \\
                    HandleWidth 5

# now, window specific changes:
Style "Fvwm*"       NoHandles, Sticky,       \\
                    WindowListSkip,          \\
                    BorderWidth 0
Style "Fvwm Pager"  StaysOnTop, BorderWidth 0
Style "*lock"       NoHandles, Sticky,       \\
                    StaysOnTop, WindowListSkip
Style "xbiff"       Sticky, WindowListSkip
Style "FvwmButtons" NoHandles, Sticky,       \\
                    WindowListSkip
Style "sxpm"        NoHandles
Style "makerkit"

# Put title-bars back on xterms only!

Style "xcalc"       Icon xcalc.xpm
Style "xbiff"       Icon mail1.xpm
Style "xmh"         Icon mail1.xpm,         \\
                    StartsOnDesk 2
Style "xman"        Icon xman.xpm
Style "matlab"      Icon math4.xpm,         \\
                    StartsOnDesk 3
Style "xmag"        Icon magnifying_glass2.xpm
Style "xgraph"      Icon graphs.xpm
Style "FvwmButtons" Icon toolbox.xpm
Style "Maker"       StartsOnDesk 1
Style "signal"      StartsOnDesk 3

# Fire up Netscape on the second desk, in the
# middle of my 3x3 virtual desktop, and don't
# bother me with it...
Style "Netscape*" SkipMapping,              \\
                  StartsOnPage 1 1 1
.EE
Note that all properties for a window will be OR'ed together.  In the
above example "FvwmPager" gets the property StaysOnTop via an exact
window name match but also gets NoHandles, Sticky, and WindowListSkip
by a match to "Fvwm*".  It will get NoTitle by virtue of a match to
"*".  If conflicting styles are specified for a window, then the last
style specified will be used.

If the NoIcon attribute is set then the specified window will simply
disappear when it is iconified.  The window can be recovered through
the window-list.  If Icon is set without an argument then the NoIcon
attribute is cleared but no icon is specified.  An example which
allows only the FvwmPager module icon to exist:
.EX
Style "*" NoIcon
Style "Fvwm Pager" Icon
.EE


.IP "Title"
Does nothing.  This is used to insert a title line in a popup or menu.


.IP "TitleStyle [ \fIjustification\fP ] [ \fIheight num\fP ]"
Sets attributes for the title bar.  Justifications can be "Centered",
"RightJustified," or "LeftJustified."  \fIheight\fP sets the title
bar's height to an amount in pixels.  Defaults are Centered and
WindowFont height.  The \fIheight\fP parameter must be set after a
WindowFont command since WindowFont resets the height to the default
for the specified font.  Example:
.EX
TitleStyle LeftJustified Height 24
.EE


.IP "TitleStyle [ \fIstate\fP ] [ \fIstyle\fP ] [ -- \fI[!]flag ...\fP ]"
Sets the style for the title bar.  \fIstate\fP can be one of
"ActiveUp," "ActiveDown," or "Inactive."  If \fIstate\fP is omitted,
then the style is added to every state.  If parentheses are placed
around the style and flags, then multiple state definitions can be
given per line.  \fIstyle\fP can be omitted so that flags can be set
while not destroying the current style.

If an "!" is prefixed to any \fIflag\fP, its behavior is negated.
Valid flags for each state include "Raised," "Flat," and "Sunk" (these
are mutually exclusive).  The default is Raised.  See the note in
ButtonStyle regarding the ActiveDown state.  Examples:
.EX
TitleStyle ActiveUp HGradient 16 navy black
TitleStyle ActiveDown (Solid red -- flat) \\
  Inactive (TiledPixmap wood.xpm)
TitleStyle ActiveUp (-- Flat) ActiveDown  \\
  (-- Raised) Inactive (-- Flat)
.EE
This sets the ActiveUp state to a horizontal gradient, the ActiveDown
state to solid red, and the Inactive state to a tiled wood pixmap.
Finally, ActiveUp is set to look flat, while ActiveDown set to be sunk
(the Raised flag for the ActiveDown state causes it to appear Sunk due
to relief inversion), and Inactive is set to flat as well.  An example
which sets flags for all states:
.EX
TitleStyle -- flat
.EE
For a flattened look:
.EX
TitleStyle -- flat
ButtonStyle All ActiveUp (-- flat) Inactive \\
  (-- flat)
.EE


.IP "UpdateDecor [ \fIdecor\fP ]"
Updates window decorations.  \fIdecor\fP is an optional argument which
specifies the \fIdecor\fP to update.  If given, only windows which are
assigned to that particular \fIdecor\fP will be updated.  This command
is useful, for instance, after a ButtonStyle, TitleStyle or
BorderStyle (possibly used in conjunction with AddToDecor).
Specifying an invalid decor results in all windows being updated.
This command is less disturbing than Recapture, but does not affect
window style options as Recapture does.


.IP "Wait \fIname\fP"
This built-in is intended to be used in \fIfvwm\fP functions only.  It
causes execution of a function to pause until a new window name
\fIname\fP appears. \fIFvwm\fP remains fully functional during a wait.
This is particularly useful in the InitFunction if you are trying to
start windows on specific desktops:
.EX
AddToFunc InitFunction
 + "I" exec xterm -geometry 80x64+0+0
 + "I" Wait xterm
 + "I" Desk 0 2
 + "I" Exec exec xmh -font fixed -geometry \\
       507x750+0+0
 + "I" Wait xmh
 + "I" Desk 0 0
.EE
The above function starts an xterm on the current desk, waits for it
to map itself, then switches to desk 2 and starts an xmh.  After the
xmh window appears control moves to desk 0.


.IP "WarpToWindow \fIx y\fP"
Warps the cursor to the associated window.  The parameters x and y
default to percentage of window down and in from the upper left hand
corner (or number of pixels down and in if 'p' is appended to the
numbers).


.IP "WindowFont [ \fIfontname\fP ]"
Makes \fIfvwm\fP use font \fIfontname\fP instead of "fixed" for window
title-bars. To reset this font to the default font (see \fIDefaultFont\fP)
you may omit \fIfontname\fP.


.IP "WindowId \fIid func\fP"
The WindowId function is similar to the Next and Prev funcs, except
that it looks for a specific window \fIid\fP and runs the specified
\fIfunc\fP on it.
.EX
WindowId 0x34567890 Raise
WindowId 0x34567890 WarpToWindow 50 50
.EE
Mostly this is useful for functions used with the WindowList builtin.


.IP "WindowList [ \fIposition\fP ] [ \fIoptions\fP ] [ \fIdouble-click-action\fP ]"
Generates a pop-up menu (and pops it up) in which the title and
geometry of each of the windows currently on the desk top are shown.
The geometry of iconified windows is shown in parenthesis.  Selecting
an item from the window list pop-up menu will by default cause the
interpreted function WindowListFunc to be run with the window id of
that window passed in as $0.  By default the WindowListFunc looks like
this:
.EX
AddToFunc WindowListFunc
 + "I" WindowId $0 Iconify -1
 + "I" WindowId $0 FlipFocus
 + "I" WindowId $0 Raise
 + "I" WindowId $0 WarpToWindow 5p 5p
.EE
You can Destroy the builtin WindowListFunc and create your own if
these defaults do not suit you.

The \fIposition\fP arguments are the same as for \fIMenu\fP. The
command \fIdouble-click-action\fP will be invoked if the user
double-clicks (or hits the key rapidly twice if the menu is bound
to a key) when bringing the window list.  The double-click-action
must be quoted if it consists of more than one word.

The double-click-action is useful to define a default window if you
have bound the window list to a key (or button) like this:
.EX
Key Tab A M WindowList "Prev FlipFocus"
.EE
Hitting Alt-Tab once it brings up the window list, if you hit it
twice the focus is flipped between the current and the last focused
window.

The \fIoptions\fP passed to WindowList can be "NoGeometry", "Function
<funcname>", "Desk <desknum>", "CurrentDesk", "NoIcons", "Icons",
"OnlyIcons", "NoNormal", "Normal", "OnlyNormal", "NoSticky", "Sticky",
"OnlySticky", "NoOnTop", "OnTop", "OnlyOnTop", "NoDeskSort", "UseIconName",
"Alphabetic", "NotAlphabetic".

(Note - normal means not iconic, sticky, or ontop)

If you pass in a function via "Function <funcname>", $0 is the window
id:
.EX
AddToFunc IFunc "I" WindowId $0 Iconify
WindowList Function IFunc, NoSticky, \\
  CurrentDesk, NoIcons
.EE

If you wanted to use the WindowList as an icon manager, you could invoke
the following:
.EX
WindowList OnlyIcons, Sticky, OnTop, Geometry
.EE
(Note - the "Only" options essentially wipe out all other ones...)


.IP "WindowsDesk \fIarg1\fP [ \fIarg2\fP ]"
Moves the selected window to another desktop (workspace, room).

This command has been removed and must be replaced by \fIMoveToDesk\fP,
the arguments for which are the same as for the \fIDesk\fP command.
\fINote:\fP You cannot simply change the name of the command: the
syntax has changed. If you used "WindowsDesk n" to move a window to
desk n, you will have to change it to "MoveToDesk 0 n".


.IP "WindowShade [ \fIopt\fP ]"
Toggles the window shade feature for titled windows.  Windows in the
shaded state only display a title bar.  If \fIopt\fP is not given, the
window shade state is toggled.  If \fIopt\fP is 1, the window is
forced to the shaded state.  If \fIopt\fP is 2, then the window is
forced to the non-shaded state.  Maximized windows and windows without
titles cannot be shaded.


.IP "XORvalue \fInumber\fP"
Changes the value with which bits are XOR'ed when doing rubber-band
window moving or resizing.  Setting this value is a trial-and-error
process.


.IP "+"
Used to continue adding to the last specified decor, function or menu.
See the discussion for AddToDecor, AddToFunc, and AddToMenu.



.SH KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
All (I think) window manager operations can be performed from the
keyboard so mouseless operation should be possible.  In addition to
scrolling around the virtual desktop by binding the Scroll built-in to
appropriate keys, pop-ups, move, resize, and most other built-ins can
be bound to keys.  Once a built-in function is started the pointer is
moved by using the up, down, left, and right arrows, and the action is
terminated by pressing return.  Holding down the shift key will cause
the pointer movement to go in larger steps and holding down the
control key will cause the cursor movement to go in smaller steps.
Standard emacs and vi cursor movement controls (^n, ^p, ^f, ^b, and
^j, ^k, ^h, ^l) can be used instead of the arrow keys.


.SH SUPPLIED CONFIGURATION
A sample configuration file, .fvwm2rc, is supplied with the \fIfvwm\fP
distribution.  It is well commented and can be used as a source of
examples for \fIfvwm\fP configuration.


.SH USE ON MULTI-SCREEN DISPLAYS
If the -s command line argument is not given, \fIfvwm\fP will
automatically start up on every screen on the specified display.
After \fIfvwm\fP starts each screen is treated independently.
Restarts of \fIfvwm\fP need to be performed separately on each screen.
The use of EdgeScroll 0 0 is strongly recommended for multi-screen
displays.

You may need to quit on each screen to quit from the X session
completely.


.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
DISPLAY
Fvwm starts on this display unless the
.I -display
option is given.
.TP
FVWM_MODULEDIR
Set by \fIfvwm\fP to the directory containing the standard \fIfvwm\fP
modules.


.SH BUGS
As of fvwm 2.2 there were exactly 46.144 unidentified bugs.
Identified bugs have mostly been fixed, though.  Since then 12.25 bugs
have been fixed.  Assuming that there are at least 10 unidentified
bugs for every identified one, that leaves us with 46.144 - 12.25 + 10
* 12.25 = 156.395 unidentified bugs.  If we follow this to its logical
conclusion we will have an infinite number of unidentified bugs before
the number of bugs can start to diminish, at which point the program
will be bug-free.  Since this is a computer program infinity =
3.4028e+38 if you don't insist on double-precision.  At the current
rate of bug discovery we should expect to achieve this point in
4.27e+27 years.  I guess I better plan on passing this thing on to my
children....

Known bugs can be found in the BUGS file in the distribution, in
the fvwm bug tracking system (accessible from the fvwm home page) and
in the TO-DO list.

Bug reports can be sent to the FVWM workers' mailing list (see the FAQ).
