## Describe the new feature

* What is it which fvwm3 doesn't do at the moment, but should?

## How might fvwm3 need to change?

* Non-technical thoughts about the impact this will have in `fvwm3`, what
  might need to change, and whether this impacts backwards-compatability.

## Can this be achieved through scripting?

* Is a proof-of-concept available externally through scripting `fvwm3`?
* Does this functionality exist elsewhere in other WMs, if so, which?
